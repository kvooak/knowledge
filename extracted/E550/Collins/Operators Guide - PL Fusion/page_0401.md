The VNAV comparator is disabled if FMS generated VNAV references are not being posted to the ADI.

ADI: Vspeed Comparator Flag

#### .

The VSPD comparator ﬂag is a caution to the ﬂight crew that the VSPEED reference values being shown on the ADI may be in error on one side or the other.

Each ADI compares the FMS-computed VSPEED references received from the on-side FMS to the VSPEED references received from the cross-side FMS. If any on-side FMS VSPEED is 2 or more knots different than its cross-side FMS counterpart, a boxed yellow VSPD miscompare ﬂag is shown to the right of the airspeed indicator tape. The ﬂag ﬂashes for 5 seconds and then changes to a steady-on state.

The VSPD comparator is disabled if FMS generated VSPEED references are not being posted to the ADI.
