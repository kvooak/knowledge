Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 MENUS AND DISPLAYS Pro Line Fusion® Avionics DU – Chart Format

Figure 5-130 Chart – Full Screen

The DU Chart format provides the ability to show an electronic version of a conventional paper instrument chart on the DU. The Charts are automatically linked by the FMS when a ﬂight plan is entered and can also be selected manually by the pilot. The available charts are listed and may be selected through on-screen menus.

The Chart format may be shown as a full or half screen. One chart may be shown on each side of the ﬂight deck, for a total of two.

When aircraft position data is available, a moving and geographically referenced aircraft symbol is shown on the Chart being shown. When the current aircraft position is not within the geographically referenced body of the chart, the aircraft symbol displays in magenta at the edge of the chart, on the azimuth relative to the current position. This can happen if the chart is panned or zoomed to an area where the aircraft is not positioned. The aircraft symbol is removed if FMS position, true heading, or magnetic variation data are missing. If the aircraft symbol is removed, the no-aircraft symbol shows in yellow on the menu bar with a white circle and slash.
