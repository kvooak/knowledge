NOTE

The Pro Line Fusion Avionics System can hold a large database of navigation aids, waypoints, and airport data to help the crew with navigation. But the crew must have and use the applicable charts, terminal procedures, and facility directories necessary for the ﬂight. Refer to the local aviation authorities for instructions about the required publications and ﬂight information to have available.

NOTE

Defects that you can see on the display surface of the Display Unit (DU) are permitted. The DU is also referred to as the Adaptive Flight Display (AFD). But these defects must not cause a distraction or make the crew read the display incorrectly. Also, defects you cannot see in an operational format from a minimum view distance are permitted.

Defective ON or defective OFF rows or columns can make servicing of the DU necessary. Groups (three or more adjacent elements) of defective ON elements are not permitted. Defective OFF elements are permitted if they do not make the crew read the display incorrectly or cause distraction.

The number of defective ON elements that are permitted include no more than: six red, six green, 10 blue, or ﬁve sets of two adjacent defects. The number of defective OFF elements that are permitted include no more than: ﬁve sets of two adjacent defects, one set of three adjacent defects, or 30 defective OFF elements.
