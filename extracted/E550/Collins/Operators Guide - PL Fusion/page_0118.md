MENUS AND DISPLAYS Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 ADI – Attitude Pro Line Fusion® Avionics

• Preventive RA cues are issued for threat trafﬁc for which the TCAS computer has determined current path resolves the threat situation. The path range to avoid is shown on the attitude display. A red trapezoidal avoidance zone path cue is positioned on the attitude display at a path attitude that results in the TCAS-commanded vertical rate. Separate path cues are provided for climb and descend restrictions. RA guidance that results in both climb and descend restrictions cause both climb and descend path cues to be shown at the same time. To comply with a RA, avoid path attitudes that are within the red avoidance zone. When a TCAS RA is active, the FPV cue changes color to red when the current path attitude is within a red avoidance zone.

• Corrective RA cues are issued for threat trafﬁc for which the TCAS computer has determined that corrective action needs to be taken to avoid the trafﬁc. The vertical speed range to seek and avoid is shown on the ADI vertical speed scale. A green rectangular ﬂy to zone is positioned immediately above or below the avoidance zone when a corrective RA is issued by the TCAS. To comply with a corrective RA, ﬂy a path attitude that is within the green ﬂy to zone. When a TCAS RA is active, the FPV changes color to green when the current path attitude is within the green ﬂy to zone.
