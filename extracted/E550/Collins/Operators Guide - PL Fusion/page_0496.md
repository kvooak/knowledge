AFCS OPERATION Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 Vertical Modes Pro Line Fusion® Avionics

The system syncs the FPA reference to the coupled-side FPA when:

• AP engaged with no other vertical mode is active

• Either FD is selected when AP is disengaged and both FDs are off

• FPA button operation/mode selection

• FMS vertical path includes an angle

• Either TCS button is pushed

• Fly-by-wire Overspeed mode is active.

The FPA reference is limited to ±9.9 degrees. The target FPA readout parks and remains visible when the target FPA value is outside the shown pitch tape range due to pitch or roll. The Target FPA Component is always displayed while FPA mode is active. The pilot can display the FPA Reference when FPA is not the active FCS vertical mode by selecting the FPA View Control on the FCP. Successive selections of the Target FPA View Control will select Manual FPA, FMS FPA and remove the FPA Reference.

#### FLIGHT LEVEL CHANGE MODE

The FG generates FD/AP commands to capture and track the speed reference displayed on the selected source PFD. This reference may be IAS or Mach, and it is selected through the SPD knob. If the speed knob switch is in MAN, the manual speed mode is selected, or if it is on FMS, FMS speed mode is selected. When the speed reference is selected to manual and TCS is active, the IAS/Mach speed reference is synchronized with the current value. The speed reference is not automatically synchronized with the FLCH in the engagement mode or with the AP engaged while FLCH is active.

1. Operate the ALT knob on the FCP to select the necessary preselect altitude.

2. Push the FLCH button on the FCP to select the FLCH mode (push-on/push-off).

3. Operate the SPD knob on the FCP to set the airspeed reference when the SPD switch is set to MAN. The airspeed reference is allowed to change up to VMO/MMO.

4. Push the IAS/MACH button in the SPD knob to toggle the speed reference from Mach to IAS, or IAS to Mach.

Push the TCS switch on either control stick to set the airspeed reference to the current airspeed when the SPD switch is set to MAN. The FLCH
