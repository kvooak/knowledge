Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 APPENDIX C Pro Line Fusion® Avionics CPDLC

## APPENDIX C

### CPDLC/ADS-C INTRODUCTION

The Controller/Pilot Datalink Communication (CPDLC) implementation is based on digital datalink communication between the aircraft and an Air Trafﬁc Control (ATC) center through either the Aeronautical Telecommunications Network (ATN) or the Future Air Navigation System (FANS) which rely on the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (ACARS) network, depending on where the aircraft is located. Routine ATC instructions and requests previously performed by voice communications can now be transmitted using CPDLC.

The Automatic Dependent Surveillance – Contract (ADS-C) is a means of airborne surveillance (deﬁned within FANS 1/A+) in which an airplane function reports its current position, intent, and other pertinent information via the data link function to an ATC facility

N

NOTE

This ATN Operator’s Guide appendix is not a training manual. It is meant to provide the user instructions on how to access the ATN, generic eCDU ﬁeld inputs, and ﬂight deck message annunciations.

 CAUTION

Some aircraft operators can have special procedures that are different from those covered in this appendix. Refer to the applicable Aircraft Flight Manual (AFM) and FAA/ICAO Operations Speciﬁcations for instructions speciﬁc to your aircraft.

### OVERVIEW

The ATN function is used in European airspace only. The FANS function is used on oceanic and continental airspace other than Europe. Both ATN and FANS provides an enhanced assessable set, in the form of reader shown text, of messages for communication between the ﬂight crew and controller.
