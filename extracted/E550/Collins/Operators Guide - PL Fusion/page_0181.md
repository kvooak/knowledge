Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 MENUS AND DISPLAYS Pro Line Fusion® Avionics PFD – HSI Format Dialog Box

N

NOTE

When the HSI is compressed, the HSI Format dialog box is compressed as well. The compressed HSI Format dialog box retains all of the selections of the non-compressed HSI Format dialog box, but the blue menu bar and gray X at the top of the menu are removed.

SELECTIONS:

OVERLAY OVERLAY contains single-state toggles to enable or disable the Weather (WX) Radar, Lightning (LX), Trafﬁc Collision Avoidance System (TCAS), and Terrain overlays for display on the HSI.

N

NOTE

If the HSI range is currently set 600 or 1000 NM and the WX, LX, or Terrain options are selected, the HSI range changes to 300 NM. TCAS trafﬁc only shows in the ﬁrst 40 NM.

HDG REF HDG REF allows the crew to select between Magnetic (MAG), and true for the heading reference.

WIND The pilots can select XY and vector wind indications on the HSI. XY presents the wind as two components, (crosswind and headwind), while VECTOR gives the wind based on direction and speed.
