Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 AFCS OPERATION Pro Line Fusion® Avionics Autothrottle

Figure 8-10 FCP, Autothrottle Section

The AT is integrated with the ﬂight guidance modes of the AFCS and the FMS. The AT includes the following functions:

• Thrust control mode

• Airspeed control mode

• Low Speed protection

• AT attempts to automatically engage when autopilot is engaged and the airspeed decreases below VMM.

• If the AT is engaged it maintains a speed no less than VMM.

• AT automatically engages when the Emergency Descent Mode (EDM) becomes active and the autopilot is engaged.

#### AUTOTHROTTLE THRUST CONTROL

If one of the ﬂight guidance modes, Takeoff, Flight Level Change, or Go Around is active, the AT automatically controls thrust to an engine rating level based on that phase of ﬂight. The throttles advance or retard to a speciﬁed thrust rating when the AT is in thrust mode.

On ground, push the AT button to arm TO. A white TO displays in the AT section of the FMA until the throttles are manually advanced above 40 degrees, at which point the AT engages and changes the display to green. When Takeoff mode is selected, the throttles advance to the Takeoff throttle position. During Takeoff Mode the Autothrottle Active Field of the FMA annunciates TO, not IDLE or CLB.
