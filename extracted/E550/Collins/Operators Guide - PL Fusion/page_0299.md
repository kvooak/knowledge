Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 MENUS AND DISPLAYS Pro Line Fusion® Avionics Map – Lightning Overlay

### MAP – LIGHTNING OVERLAY

Figure 5-113 Lightning Overlay

The optional non-Rockwell Collins Lightning Detection System (LDS) detects various levels of lightning activity and processes detected Lightning (LX) information to be shown on the ﬂight displays. Lightning symbology in the form of lightning bolt icons is shown at the relative bearing and distance to the aircraft. The LDS limits lightning detection to approximately 200 NM from the aircraft. Refer to the vendor-supplied LDS Operations Manual for additional details.

NOTE

Lightning data and the terrain overlay cannot be shown at the same time on a single display. Manual or automatic selection of the terrain overlay automatically removes the lightning overlay. Similarly, selection of the lightning overlay automatically deselects the terrain overlay.

The LX overlay is selected on the DU Map Overlay menu.
