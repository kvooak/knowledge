VHF Communi- cations (COM) Transceiver

The Communications (COM) is a multichannel VHF transceiver that provides AM voice communications. Three COM transceivers are installed, one that is datalink-capable (a second datalink-capable COM transceiver is optional). The COM transceiver is conﬁgured with an emergency tuning feature that automatically tunes 121.5 MHz when primary power to the COM is cycled with no tuning inputs from the AFD present, or the emergency tuning feature may be manually selected with controls on the RSP.

XM Satellite Receiver The non-Rockwell Collins XM Satellite datalink receiver receives a constant broadcast of graphical and textual weather data from the XM Satellite Radio weather service. The digital weather data as well as operating and fault data is supplied to the AFD.
