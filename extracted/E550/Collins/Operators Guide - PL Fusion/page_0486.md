AFCS OPERATION Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 Flight Guidance Transfer Pro Line Fusion® Avionics

Figure 8-3 AP Source Button

The couple arrow powers up to the left side when started on ground and in the air. Push the SRC button on the FCP to toggle ﬂight guidance between the pilot and copilot side.

Upon ﬂight guidance transfer, the basic FPA and Roll modes are selected when a FD is active or when the AP is engaged. The FCS system sources everything from the couple side PFD. Attitude, air data and navigation information. Preselect altitude, preselect vertical speed, target FPA, target heading and target airspeed are system synchronized and can never be different between the pilot’s and copilot’s side.

The couple arrow shows in the bottom half on the AP engage ﬁeld. The couple arrow shows in green, when present, and when the AP engage/disengage message ﬂashes. When the AP engaged/disengaged message is not in view, the couple arrow shows in white and does not ﬂash.

The unﬁlled arrowhead (if conﬁgured) indicates the non-coupled side.

The ﬂight director is only independent during Approach 2 ILS mode, the ﬂight director is never independent during LPV approach, it is always dependent during LPV and all other FMS approaches.

If the SRC button is pushed during TO or GA without the AP engaged, the FD is removed from the ADI.
