MENUS AND DISPLAYS Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 Map – Vertical Situation Display Pro Line Fusion® Avionics

• No ground track for segment.

If the lateral reference frame is track, a green TRACK annunciation displays at the left end of the distance scale.

Vertical Predictor The vertical predictor extends from the nose of the aircraft symbol to the 1/4 range line. The vertical predictor is based on current vertical speed. The vertical predictor does not show if the vertical speed is less than 300 ft/min.

Preselect Altitude Preselect altitude shows on the VSD as a preselect altitude bug, horizontal line, and digital readout.

Terrain The Terrain overlay on the VSD is always active.

Absolute terrain data is shown in proﬁle across the x-axis of the VSD. Terrain data is removed from the VSD if a TERRAIN FAIL condition exists. Relative terrain displays in the same colors as on the lateral maps, and displays as horizontal bands.

If the TAWS database is lacking terrain deﬁnition for a location, a No Data magenta rectangle represents the location on the VSD.

Alerted terrain shows on the VSD in the same color rules as on the lateral maps. Alerted terrain shows in vertical bands. Alerted terrain on the VSD does not ﬂash.
