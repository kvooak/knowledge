Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 MENUS AND DISPLAYS Pro Line Fusion® Avionics Map – Radar Overlay

PAC Alert Arc The Path Attenuation Compensa- tion (PAC) feature automatically compensates for radar beam absorption by heavier rainfall rates when the WXR is in AUTO mode, GAIN is set to NORM, and GCS is ON. The compensation provided by the PAC alert function can be exceeded. A yellow PAC alert arc is shown at the perimeter of the radar dis- play to identify where the compensation has been exceeded. Areas of unknown rainfall rates may exist beyond the PAC alert arc.

WXR Data Block The WXR data block is shown along the left side of the display above the TCAS data block. A WXR overlay indicator, WXR mode annunciation, receiver gain setting, antenna tilt angle readout or Autotilt mode annunciation, or radar fault message, are all shown in the WXR data block. The WXR data block is shortened to show only the WXR overlay indicator when the WXR overlay is not selected to show.

• The ﬁrst line of the WXR data block shows the current WXR overlay selected. The overlay indicator displays WX/LX. WX shows in cyan text when the WXR overlay is enabled, and in white text when the WXR overlay is disabled.
