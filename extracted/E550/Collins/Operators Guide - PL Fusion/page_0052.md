OVERVIEW – SYSTEM COMPONENTS Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 System Description Pro Line Fusion® Avionics

• Aircraft systems data is concentrated by a Data Concentration System (DCS) for distribution to the IPS and the ﬂight deck displays. The DCS also houses the software for CAS, ECL, Synoptics, AT, and ﬂight control functions.

• Four AFD provide primary attitude, heading, altitude, airspeed, navigation, and ﬂight guidance functions. In this guide and in the on-screen menus, an AFD is also called a DU. The DU are identical but are called DU1, DU2, and DU3, from left to right, respectively, and the lower DU is called DU4.

• The displays shall receive data directly from primary sensors and the DCS as well as concentrated data from the IPS.

• The interconnection architecture ensures that after loss of data from the IPS, essential display data is still provided to both crew members.
