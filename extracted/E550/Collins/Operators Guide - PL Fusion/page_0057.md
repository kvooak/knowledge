Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 OVERVIEW – SYSTEM COMPONENTS Pro Line Fusion® Avionics System Description

Display Control Panel (DCP) The Display Control Panel (DCP) manipulates information associated with the Primary Flight Display (PFD). Each DCP controls the on-side information, including weather radar, Trafﬁc Alert Collision Avoidance System (TCAS), Combined Vision System (CVS) (Synthetic Vision System (SVS) and Enhanced Vision System (EVS) combined), Flight Path Vector (FPV), navigation sources, and Horizontal Situation Indicator (HSI) format.

Distance Mea- suring Equip- ment (DME)

The Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) transceiver provides distance, time-to-station, ground speed, and station identiﬁcation information for use by the navigation and hazard avoidance subsystems. The DME can track up to three DME stations at a time. Normally, station one is manually tuned and the data is shown on the ﬂight displays. Distance information from stations two and three is used by the Flight Management System (FMS) to aid in the calculation of navigation solutions. The FMS autotune feature allows the FMS to automatically tune channel one and VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR) one. One DME transceiver is installed and a second receiver is optional.
