AFCS OPERATION Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 Vertical Modes Pro Line Fusion® Avionics

#### HALF BANK MODE

Lateral autopilot and ﬂight director commands can be limited to the nominal bank angle limitation of ±30 degrees. When the Half Bank function is active, however, these limits are reduced to ±15 degrees. The AFGS automatically transitions to the half-bank limit of 15 degrees, when the airplane altitude is greater than 25 000 ft during a climb.

It will also automatically transition to the high bank limit of 35 degrees when the airplane’s altitude is less than 25 000 ft during a descent. Hysteresis is also implemented between the two states in order to prevent switching between ON and OFF around the automatic transition altitude (25 000 ft).

### VERTICAL MODES

The FG vertical modes are:

• Altitude Hold

• Altitude Select

• Flight Path Angle

• Flight Level Change

• Go Around

• Takeoff

• Vertical Navigation

• Vertical Speed.
