• Radio altitude at or below 200 feet – 2.00 degrees.

ADI: Glideslope Comparator Flag

#### .

Monitor pilot and copilot glideslope deviation information.

The GS comparator ﬂag is a caution to the ﬂight crew that the glideslope deviation information being shown on the ADI may be in error on one side or the other.

During a monitored approach, each ADI compares the glideslope deviation from the on-side NAV receiver to the glideslope deviation from the cross-side NAV receiver. When the glideslope compare function is active and the difference between the two glideslope deviations is not within the predeﬁned limit, a boxed yellow GS glideslope miscompare ﬂag is shown below the vertical deviation scale. The ﬂag ﬂashes for 5 seconds and then changes to a steady-on state.

The glideslope deviation comparator is disabled during unmonitored approaches or when radio altitude is less than either the RA MIN setpoint or 100 feet, whichever is greater.
