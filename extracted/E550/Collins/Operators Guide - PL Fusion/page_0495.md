Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 AFCS OPERATION Pro Line Fusion® Avionics Vertical Modes

#### ALTITUDE HOLD MODE

The Altitude Hold mode generates FD/AP commands to maintain the correct barometric altitude reference. The altitude reference can be synchronized by pushing the TCS button on the sidesticks. The altitude hold reference is resynchronized with the existing altitude if the mode is selected, and the AP is engaged at a later time if altitude error is greater than 200 ft. The Altitude Hold mode can be selected by pushing the ALT button on the guidance panel. The Altitude Hold mode can also be activated automatically, followed by Altitude Select mode.

#### ALTITUDE SELECT MODE

The Altitude Select mode is used in conjunction with another vertical mode. While a different vertical mode is used to ﬂy towards the desired altitude, the Altitude Select mode captures and levels off at the selected altitude. At altitude capture, ASEL becomes the active vertical mode replacing the active vertical mode that was used to ﬂy towards the selected altitude. The FG generates ﬂight path command outputs to capture the preselect altitude displayed on the selected PFD. Once the reference altitude is reached, altitude hold mode is activated. AFGS uses BARO corrected altitude in the Altitude Select (ASEL) mode.

#### FLIGHT PATH ANGLE MODE

The Flight Path Angle is the basic vertical mode. It becomes the active FG mode when the FG is engaged and no other vertical mode(s) is active. The FG generates ﬂight director/autopilot commands to capture and track the ﬂight path reference displayed on the selected PFD. The FPA reference is resynchronized to the current ﬂight path attitude by pushing the TCS buttons on the control wheel, maneuvering the aircraft to a new ﬂight path attitude and subsequently, releasing the TCS button. pushing the FD button when FD is in OFF mode causes the FPA mode to become active. Engaging the autopilot when FD is in OFF mode is active also causes FPA to become the active mode. The ﬂight path angle reference is limited to ±9.9 degrees, while FPA mode is active.

To use the FPA mode manually, operate the FCP as follows:

1. Operate the ALT knob on the FCP to select the necessary preselect altitude, different from the current level.

2. Push the FPA button to select the FPA mode.

3. Operate the FPA knob as desired to select a different angle.
