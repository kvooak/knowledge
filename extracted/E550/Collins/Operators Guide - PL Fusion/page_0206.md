MENUS AND DISPLAYS Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 Synoptic – Electrical Page Pro Line Fusion® Avionics

Generators are depicted by circles with green numbers showing voltage and amperes. Generators turned off are depicted by white circles, an undetermined generator is a yellow dashed circle, and a failed generator is white circle with a red X.

A Ground Power Unit (GPU) is depicted by a green rectangle with green numbers when plugged into the aircraft and giving proper power. The GPU is connected and available. It is green when connected and in use. When disconnected, the GPU is hidden from view on the synoptic.

Generators Each Generator (GEN) is depicted by a circle with a white legend and a colored outline.

Gen 1 and Gen 2 also displays a data block including the following information:

• Voltage (V)

• Current (A).

The data blocks for both primary generators show voltage and current. The data block for the RAT generator displays only voltage. The data blocks for the APU generator show voltage and current.
