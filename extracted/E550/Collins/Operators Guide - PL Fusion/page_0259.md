Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 MENUS AND DISPLAYS Pro Line Fusion® Avionics Checklist

Figure 5-94 Checklist – Emergency Index Page

The Checklist format on the DU provides controls to store, retrieve, and view aircraft-speciﬁc checklists. The checklists are hosted on the Data Concentration System (DCS). There are Auto Sensed Checklist items and Auto Reset Checklist items. Sometimes a checklist can contain an automatically sensed checklist item. For example, the Before Landing checklist may contain an item called LDG GEAR LEVER....DN. When the pilot places the landing gear lever in the down position, the checklist can automatically sense that the pilot has placed the landing gear lever in the down position. The EICAS application will automatically advance to the next checklist item in the list. If a checklist item is auto sensed, no checkbox will be available for selection next to the checklist item’s text.

Checklists can contain an auto reset feature. Checklists can be reset automatically when either weight on wheels is true or when the TOGA (takeoff go around) push button on the throttle quadrant is pushed. This feature must be enabled for a particular checklist when created using the RCCT checklist tool.
