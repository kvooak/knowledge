MENUS AND DISPLAYS Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 HSI Format Pro Line Fusion® Avionics

provide a clean presentation of just the navigation indications. FMS map indications are available when FMS is the navigation source on the HSI, they are not available when VOR/LOC is the navigation source.

The HUD shows a simpliﬁed version of the HSI with many of the same heading and navigation indications.

SELECTIONS:

NAV Source Data Block

The NAV source data block displays information relative to the active NAV source. Each side of the cockpit may independently select a NAV source. The NAV source data block indicates the selected NAV source, the next FMS waypoint or NAVAID frequency or ID, the course desire/track readout, Time To Go (TTG) to the waypoint or NAVAID, and distance to the waypoint or NAVAID.

• The NAV source is selected with controls in the NAV Source Dialog Box on the PFD Task Menu or via the FMS and V/L buttons on the DCP. The selected NAV source drives the on-side navigation displays. The NAV source data block is shown in the upper left corner of the HSI format. The NAV source color is:

• Green for a VOR/LOC on-side NAV source

• Magenta for FMS on-side NAV source or third FMS

• Yellow for a cross-side NAV source.

• The ID line automatically changes to show the waypoint name, NAVAID frequency, or NAVAID ID based on the currently selected NAV source.
