Valves Valves are dynamic graphical features that are used to indicate ﬂow (ﬂuid or air) control and typically reﬂect the upstream component or feature status. Valves consist of a static circular outline and a dynamic three position interior ﬂow line. When a valve is parallel to its respective ﬂow line, it is open. When a valve is perpendicular to its respective ﬂow line, it is closed. A valve in transition is shown as a diagonal to the ﬂow line. White circles indicate a working valve, a red X indicates a failed valve. If a valve position can not be determined the system shows a dashed yellow circle.
