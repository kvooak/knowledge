• A LOC excessive deviation is indicated by ﬂashing the LOC deviation pointer and turning the pointer yellow for the duration of the excessive deviation. This indication is available during a Category II ILS approach when the radio altitude is between 700 feet and 100 feet.

• The to/from arrow is a hollow triangle on the course/desired track pointer. The arrow points toward the head of the pointer to indicate a TO and toward the tail to indicate a FROM. The indication is always a TO when the active NAV source is FMS. The arrow is shown in the same color as the course/desired track pointer.
