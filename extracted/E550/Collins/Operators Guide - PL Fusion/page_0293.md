Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 MENUS AND DISPLAYS Pro Line Fusion® Avionics Map – Radar Overlay

### MAP – RADAR OVERLAY

Figure 5-112 Map Radar Overlay Full Page

The MultiScan™Weather Radar (WXR) System detects and locates precipitation and precipitation-related turbulence returns. The WXR depicts the bearing, range, and precipitation rate of all detectable precipitation within the scan area and display range. A ground mapping mode is used to show ground mapping returns. The system functions like two independent radars. The weather radar display and associated settings for each pilot are controlled from on-side controls and are updated on alternate sweeps of the antenna. The pilot’s display sweeps from the left to the right, while the copilot’s display sweeps from the right to the left.
