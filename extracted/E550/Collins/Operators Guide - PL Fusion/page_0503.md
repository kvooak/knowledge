Moreover, the AFGS will synchronize the FD commands to the current ROL and FPA values, and set the AP NZ command to zero and AP roll command to current roll value while TCS function is active. Upon TCS switch release, the AP breakout force will be reactivated and FG will continue to generate FD and AP commands to the PFD and FCC.

### APPROACH MODES

#### AFGS SUPPORT TO ILS APPROACH OPERATIONS

The AFGS provides two types of system conﬁguration to support ILS approach operations (APPR 1 and APPR 2). These two types provide an optimized balance between high availability and high integrity.

The AFGS is designed to provide the highest integrity level available to the pilots, i.e. the nominal conﬁguration after pilot selecting ILS approach modes activate APPR 2, as long as the system is capable and the proper conﬁgurations have been selected. Regardless of minimums selection, the system will typically operate in APPR 2 conﬁguration.

#### APPROACH 2 OPERATION

APPR arms when:

• APPR 2 is capable

• LOC is active or view source on both PFDs

• LOC frequencies are equal

• APPR button is pushed

A nominal APPR 2 operation occurs as follows:
