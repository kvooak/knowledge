Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 MENUS AND DISPLAYS Pro Line Fusion® Avionics Synoptic – Bleed Air/Anti-Ice Page

Shut Off Valves The bleed air pressure can be shut off using several valves. Valves include the Pressure Relief and Shut Off Valve (PRSOV) from each engine to the rest of the system, and a Anti-ice Shut Off Valve (AISOV) to stop bleed air from entering the wings and horizontal stabilizer.

Cross Bleed The anti-ice system is capable of being run by either engine. In case of running problems with one engine bleed air producing the required bleed air for anti ice the Cross Bleed (XBLEED) valve can be opened.

Engines/APU The engines are depicted by bitmap images. The Engine Anti-Ice Valve (EAIV) directs bleed air through the engine anti ice. The APU is depicted as a gray shape with a green outline when the engines are running.
