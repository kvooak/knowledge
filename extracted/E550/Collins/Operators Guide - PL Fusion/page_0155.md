Flight Guidance Mode Reversion

Flight Guidance mode reversion occurs whenever the data required for the active mode(s) is failed or missing (for example, no valid VOR signal when the NAV mode is active and VOR is active NAV source). During ﬂight guidance mode reversion, the AFCS continues to provide ﬂight guidance based on the basic FPA and Roll hold modes.
