Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 MESSAGES AND ANNUNCIATORS Pro Line Fusion® Avionics Visual Annunciations

ADI: Pitch Compare Flag

The PIT comparator ﬂag is a caution to the ﬂight crew that the pitch being given by the AHRS are may be in error on one side or the other.

Each ADI compares the pitch from the on-side AHRS to the heading from the cross-side AHRS. When the pitch compare function is active and the difference between the two pitch angles is not within the predeﬁned limit, a boxed yellow PIT miscompare ﬂag is shown below the ﬂight mode annunciation display. The ﬂag ﬂashes for 5 seconds and then changes to a steady-on state.

ADI: TAWS GND PROX Alert

#### .

The yellow GND PROX caution alert overwrites the pitch scale in the lower half of the attitude display when the EGPWS computer determines that a terrain threat exists that requires immediate pilot attention. The GND PROX alert ﬂashes for 5 seconds and then shows steady.

The GND PROX and WINDSHEAR caution alerts share the same display ﬁeld, so only one can show at a time. The GND PROX caution alert has priority.
