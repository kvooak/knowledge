Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 MENUS AND DISPLAYS Pro Line Fusion® Avionics Map – Radar Overlay

WX ON GROUND Message

When any mode other than STBY or TEST is selected and it is more than 35 seconds after an air-to-ground transition (with weight on wheels), the message WX ON GROUND is shown in white in the ﬁrst line of the WXR data block to indicate that the weather radar is transmitting. The message is also shown when any mode other than STBY or TEST is selected, it is more than 3 seconds after power up, and there is weight on wheels.

Weather Radar Display Range

Weather radar data is available with selected ranges up to 300 NM. If the display range is at a value greater than 300 NM when the pilot selects the weather radar overlay, the display range is automatically reduced to 300 NM. When the weather radar overlay is active, selection of ranges greater than 300 NM causes the WXR overlay to be removed from the display. The range control on the DU Map or HSI is used to set the display ranges.

N

NOTE

Extending outward from the aircraft symbol is a blanked range area. The size of this blanked range area equals 0.6 NM. The blanked range does not display any Weather Radar returns.

N

NOTE

Radar returns can be shown out to a range of 300 NM. When the WXR overlay is active, selection of ranges greater than 300 NM causes the WXR overlay to be removed from the display.
