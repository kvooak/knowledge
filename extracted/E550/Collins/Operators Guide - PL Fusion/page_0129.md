Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 MENUS AND DISPLAYS Pro Line Fusion® Avionics ADI – Altitude

• The pilot and copilot-side pressure settings are not synchronized. When the pressure settings for the pilot and copilot are different by more than 0.01 inHg or one hPa, the barometric pressure readout changes to yellow.

• Range for the barometric pressure setting is 22.00 to 32.50 inHg or 745 to 1100 hPa.

• The BARO pressure design allows swapping the active BARO pressure setting between standard and user-set values. A user-set value is displayed numerically, and a standard value is displayed as the text string STD. If the active value is standard, and the user-set value is changed via a physical or soft control, a preset BARO setting value is placed on the PFD below the active (STD) setting. The preset value is always the current user-set value. When a preset is present a swap of the BARO settings makes the user-set value the active setting, and the preset display is removed.

Radio Altitude Analog radio altitude is shown in the altitude scale area to improve ground awareness. A digital readout of radio altitude is located in the lower part of the attitude indicator under a RA heading.
