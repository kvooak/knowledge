AFCS OPERATION Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 Vertical Modes Pro Line Fusion® Avionics

FMS Path modes (PATH and GP) are slightly different in that the FMS calculates vertical steering commands and sends them to AFGS. VNAV is initially selected by the pilot using the VNAV or APPR buttons on the FCP, while FMS is the active or navigation view source.

VNAV is armed, being displayed in white in the armed vertical mode annunciation on the FMA. When the active ﬂight plan can be captured, VNAV is engaged, and the active vertical mode is indicated to the pilots on the FMA, in magenta to indicate that it is in FMS mode, as one of the following:

• FLCH

• ASEL

• ALT

• PATH

• GP.

#### VERTICAL SPEED MODE

During Vertical Speed mode, AFGS generates FD/AP commands to capture and track the vertical speed reference displayed on the selected source PFD. At VS mode activation, the vertical speed reference is synchronized with the current aircraft vertical speed. The reference can then be changed by turning the vertical speed thumbwheel on the FCP.

VS mode remains active until another mode is selected, or until ASEL is automatically engaged when airplane is close to the target altitude reference.

Accomplish the following to set up a VS climb or descent:

1. Operate the ALT knob on the FCP to select the necessary preselect altitude.

2. Push the VS button on the FCP to select the VS mode (push-on/push-off).
