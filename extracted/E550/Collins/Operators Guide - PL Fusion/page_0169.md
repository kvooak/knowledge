Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 MENUS AND DISPLAYS Pro Line Fusion® Avionics HSI – Map

In certain display failure scenarios (center display for example) that place the EICAS quarter format next to a half PFD, the HSI, ADI and EICAS can all be compressed and displayed in a single half format by pushing the RSP EICAS button, freeing up the half MFW next to it.

When display reversion is selected with the EICAS button on the RSP with certain DU failed, the ADI and HSI are compressed above the EICAS display. The selection of the DISPLAYS switch affects both sides of the ﬂight deck.

The compressed HSI shows an abbreviated compass rose, and most of the same information as the non-compressed HSI. The compressed HSI removes the following information:

• Range control.

• Trafﬁc displays and information.

• Weather radar returns and information.

When the HSI is compressed, the PFD Format menu and all submenus are compressed as well.

### HSI – MAP

The HSI format can display Map data in addition to standard HSI information. The HSI Map display is centered on the aircraft symbol and shows in a heading up orientation.

The HSI Map is selected for display by pushing the HSI button on the DCP.
