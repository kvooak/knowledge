MENUS AND DISPLAYS Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 HSI Format Pro Line Fusion® Avionics

HSI Declutter The HSI has three states of operation:

• CDI indications with overlays.

• FMS map indications with overlays.

• Clean HSI (all overlays removed.

N

NOTE

The DCP HSI button toggles between these three states. The clean HSI quickly removes all the overlays to provide a clean presentation of just the navigation indications. FMS map indications are available when FMS is the navigation source on the HSI, they are not available when VOR/LOC is the navigation source.

Display Range The range ring is a circle encompassing the aircraft symbol. The range readout is shown in a box on the left side of the range ring.

The HSI range is independent of any MFW maps that may be displayed.

The HSI range is set using the range knob on the DCP or placing the cursor on the HSI and using the CCP outer dual stack knob (DSK). The standard display ranges are: 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, and 300 NM. 600 and 1000 NM range selections are also available.

N

NOTE

When the weather radar overlay is selected to be shown while the 600 or 1000 NM range is selected, the display range is automatically reduced to 300 NM.
