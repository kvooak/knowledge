DISPLAY OPERATION Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 DU Window Allocation Pro Line Fusion® Avionics

EICAS is reverted on a half screen PFD, EICAS is kept in a separate MFW, leaving one quarter of the DU for another MFW.

In a normal condition, EICAS is placed in a 1/4 MFW on the top center DU, leaving room for a 1/4 and a 1/2 screen format. If either the pilot or copilot manually revert the EICAS window, the full top center DU can be used for full screen MFW or two 1/2 screen MFW.

The lower center DU can be used for full screen, 1/2 screen, and 1/4 screen MFW formats. QAK shortcuts take the user directly to the lower center DU.

Due to system limitation and safety of ﬂight, there are limits to how the operator can conﬁgure the DU formats. For the purposes of DU format allocation, the ﬂight deck is divided into two sides. DU1 and DU2 are the left side, and DU3 and DU4 are the right side. Restrictions on how many formats may be shown at any time per side of the ﬂight deck only apply when all four DU panels are operating.

Figure 7-7 DU Format Controls

The following totals show the number of speciﬁc windows per DU, per side of the ﬂight deck, and number total on the ﬂight deck.
