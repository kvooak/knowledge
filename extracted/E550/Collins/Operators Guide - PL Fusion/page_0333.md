### CHART – DATA ENTRY WINDOW

Figure 5-141 Chart – Data Entry Window

The Data Entry Window provides controls to search the database for airports based on selectable criteria. The Data Entry Window consists of a list of search results, a search parameter combo box, and a data entry line. The MKP is used to enter text into the data entry line, and the results show in the list above. If the search results extend beyond the available window, a scroll list control shows at the right edge of the list. If the search returns no results, the message NO MATCHES FOUND shows.
