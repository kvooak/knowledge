AFCS OPERATION Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 Autothrottle Pro Line Fusion® Avionics

When FLCH is selected on the FCP or automatically by the FMS (VNAV), the throttles advance to the Climb thrust rating or retard to the ﬂight idle limit. The pilot may select other thrust ratings during climb using the FMS VNAV-THRST format page. During FLCH mode the Autothrottle Active Field in the FMA annunciates CLB if the aircraft is climbing and IDLE if the aircraft is descending.

When Go Around mode is selected, the AT sets the thrust to the Takeoff throttle position. A green GA annunciation shows.

When Windshear mode is selected by the activation of a windshear warning, the throttles automatically advance to the takeoff thrust position. A green WSHR annunciation shows.

When Approach mode is selected, the AT retards the throttles to the idle throttle lever range when ﬂaps are in position 3 or 4 and the radar altimeter is less than 30 feet.

RETD is displayed in the Autothrottle Arm ﬁeld prior to retard mode activating and RETD being displayed in green in the Autothrottle Active Field when Retard Mode is active.

#### AUTOTHROTTLE AIRSPEED CONTROL

The throttles are controlled to hold a speciﬁed IAS or Mach when the AT is in airspeed mode. If one of the ﬂight guidance modes Altitude Capture, Altitude Hold, Vertical Speed, FPA, PATH, GP, or Glideslope is active or subsequently selected, the AT automatically holds selected airspeed. The speed reference is selectable by the pilot either through the FMS, or through the SPD knob on the FCP. When the speed reference is changed, the AT acquires the new selected airspeed. The reference may be IAS or Mach. If a ﬂight guidance mode is not selected, the AT provides basic airspeed hold control.

Adjust the reference speed with the SPD knob on the FCP or through FMS waypoint constraints.

Push the PUSH IAS/MACH button inside the SPD knob to select IAS or Mach as the speed reference.

A green SPEED annunciation shows on the PFD when the AT is active. A yellow LIM annunciation shows when the AT can not reach the requested airspeed.
