MESSAGES AND ANNUNCIATORS Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 Visual Annunciations Pro Line Fusion® Avionics

During a monitored approach, each ADI compares the lateral deviation from the on-side AHRS to the lateral deviation from the cross-side AHRS. When the localizer compare function is active and the difference between the two lateral deviations is not within a predeﬁned limit, a boxed yellow AHRS miscompare ﬂag is shown to the left of the horizontal deviation scale. The ﬂag ﬂashes for 5 seconds and then changes to a steady-on state.

ADI: Localizer Compare Flag

#### .

The LOC comparator ﬂag is a caution to the ﬂight crew that the localizer deviation information being shown on the ADI may be in error on one side or the other.

During a monitored approach, each ADI compares the localizer deviation from the on-side receiver to the localizer deviation from the cross-side receiver. When the localizer compare function is active and the difference between the two localizer deviations is not within a predeﬁned limit, a boxed yellow LOC miscompare ﬂag is shown to the left of the horizontal deviation scale. The ﬂag ﬂashes for 5 seconds and then changes to a steady-on state.

The localizer deviation comparator is disabled during unmonitored approaches or when radio altitude is less than either the RA MIN setpoint or 100 feet, whichever is greater.
