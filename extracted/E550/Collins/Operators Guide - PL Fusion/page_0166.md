MENUS AND DISPLAYS Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 HSI Format Pro Line Fusion® Avionics

• The bearing source can be FMS, VOR, or ADF. The bearing source is numbered (1 or 3) to indicate the source side (pilot or copilot) when more than one source of each type is installed. The bearing source is blank if the BRG source selection is OFF. The number 1 bearing source and icon and number 2 bearing source and icon are shown in the same color as the associated bearing pointer.

• When available, bearing distance is shown to the right of the bearing icon in the same color as the bearing pointer. For VOR bearing, the bearing distance is blank if DME Hold is selected. The up to four-digit bearing distance readout uses a decimal point to separate tenths and is shown with a NM legend. When the selected bearing is also the active NAV source, then the bearing distance is not shown.

Wind Magnitude and Direction

Wind magnitude and direction is shown in green in the upper right corner of the HSI. Wind indications are displayed when wind speed is 7 knots or greater and removed when the wind speed drops to 5 knots or less. Wind magnitude and direction are sourced from the FMS used as the current NAV source, or the on-side FMS if FMS is not the current NAV source. There are two options for display of wind information: VECTOR and XY, the selection for WIND indications is in the HSI format dialog box.
