AFCS OPERATION Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 Vertical Modes Pro Line Fusion® Avionics

#### UNDERSPEED PROTECTION

During an underspeed condition, additional levels of protection are provided. When the airspeed is below the top of the Low Speed Awareness (LSA) white bar, the Autothrottle will automatically be engaged if the Autopilot (AP) is engaged.

The speed reference will be set at the LSA white bar, plus a small offset. If the airspeed keeps on decreasing and gets below the top of the LSA amber bar, the AOA limit function provided by the FBW system will become active. When the AOA limit function is activated, AP will disengage and the airplane will be protected against stall and buffeting at high Mach.

#### TOUCH CONTROL STEERING

When AP is engaged, pilots are allowed to manually change the airplane state by using the Touch Control Steering (TCS) function, without disengaging the AP. If the Go-Around vertical mode is the active mode, TCS function will not be available. The Flight Guidance applications will synchronize the mode references to the current values while TCS is active for the following list of modes:

TCS Activation Modes

Active Mode Reference

ROL Roll Angle

ROL Heading

FLCH Airspeed

ALT Altitude

FPA Flight Path Angle

VS Vertical Speed

The respective reference bugs on the PFD are also synchronized for the following modes according to the table below:
