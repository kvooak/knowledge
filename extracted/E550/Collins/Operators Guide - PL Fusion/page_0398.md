MESSAGES AND ANNUNCIATORS Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 Visual Annunciations Pro Line Fusion® Avionics

Each ADI compares the on-side radio altitude to the cross-side radio altitude whenever the radio altitude is less than 2450 feet AGL. When the radio altitude compare function is active and the difference between the radio altitude supplied to the on-side and cross-side ADI is not within the pre-deﬁned limit, a boxed yellow RAD radio altitude miscompare ﬂag is shown at the bottom of the attitude indicator display. The ﬂag ﬂashes for 5 seconds and then changes to a steady-on state.

The RAD comparator limit is variable and is a function of altitude.

ADI: Roll Compare Flag

The ROL comparator ﬂag is a caution to the ﬂight crew that the roll being given by the AHRS are may be in error on one side or the other.

Each ADI compares the roll from the on-side AHRS to the heading from the cross-side AHRS. When the roll compare function is active and the difference between the two roll rates is not within the predeﬁned limit, a boxed yellow ROL miscompare ﬂag is shown below the ﬂight mode annunciation display. The ﬂag ﬂashes for 5 seconds and then changes to a steady-on state.
