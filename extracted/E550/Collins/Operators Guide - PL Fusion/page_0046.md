OVERVIEW Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 System Description Pro Line Fusion® Avionics

Trafﬁc Alert Col- lision Avoidance System (TCAS) II

The second-generation Trafﬁc Alert Collision Avoidance System (TCAS), TCAS II, is designed to protect a volume of airspace around the TCAS equipped aircraft by warning the pilots of the threat of other transponder equipped aircraft that penetrate that airspace. The TCAS is made up of a TCAS transceiver, two antennas, and two Mode S transponders with antennas. The system interrogates Mode C and Mode S transponders in nearby aircraft and analyzes their replies to identify potential and predicted collision threats. The system advises the pilot when to climb, descend, or maintain altitude to avoid passing too close to or colliding with threat aircraft. When an intruder aircraft is equipped with TCAS, the system coordinates avoidance maneuvers with this aircraft using the datalink capability of the Mode S transponders. The system receives altitude and vertical speed information from the ADS, radio altitude information from the RAD ALT, and heading information from the AHRS. The TCAS system generates vertical guidance commands that are shown on the PFD, target displays that can be shown on all ﬂight displays, and aural alerts that sound over the cockpit audio system. TCAS displays are controlled from the on-screen menus on the AFD.

#### KEY TROUBLESHOOTING FEATURES

• The third and cross-side air data sources can be selected as the source of on-side air data in the event of an on-side failure on the ground. When airborne, air data reversion can be automatic or manual.

• Automatic display reversion reformats the operating displays to show all essential ﬂight data.

• The cross-side attitude heading source can be selected as the source of on-side attitude heading information in the event of an on-side failure on the ground. When airborne, attitude heading reversion can be automatic or manual.
