VNAV Vertical Navigation Select Button

The VNAV button is used to select and deselect Vertical Navigation (VNAV) mode. VNAV mode enables the FMS to command various AFCS vertical modes, and provide references for these modes. VNAV is armed by pushing the VNAV switch. Selection of VNAV does not automatically change the active guidance mode. When VNAV is armed the FMS can automatically select the AFCS vertical mode it requires. The pilot may manually change any of the AFCS mode selections made by the FMS. Such pilot action suspends the current FMS VNAV control of the AFCS, but does not preclude automatic reassertion of control by the FMS. When VNAV is enabled, Path and Glidepath modes may also be selected by the FMS. In Path mode, the AFCS generates commands to track the vertical path deﬁned by the FMS. In Glidepath mode, the AFCS generates commands to track the vertical glidepath deﬁned by the FMS. When in VNAV modes, the AT controls either airspeed or thrust depending upon the vertical mode that is active.
