AFCS OPERATION Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 Approach Modes Pro Line Fusion® Avionics

• Selected courses are NOT equal.

If any of above statements is true, and the pilots push the APPR button, LOC and GS modes are armed on the lateral and the vertical axis, respectively, as well as in APPR 2, but in this case, APPR 1 will be displayed as it is armed on the FMA.

LOC mode will activate and will command the capture and tracking of the beam, when the airplane is sufﬁciently close to the localizer beam, as follows.

• Once the airplane is sufﬁciently close to the GS beam, GS mode will activate. Depending on the scenario, APPR 1 may be activated at this time, or it may still be displayed as armed until the airplane descends below 800 ft radio altitude.

The ﬁrst scenario (when APPR 1 may be activated) will occur if APPR 2 is not capable, as followed. The second scenario (when APPR 1 may still be displayed as armed) will occur if APPR 2 is capable.

#### SYNTHETIC VISION GUIDANCE SYSTEM

Synthetic Vision Guidance System (SVGS) uses the Synthetic Vision System (SVS) technology on the Head Down Display (HDD) and/or the Head Up Display (HUD) to obtain a lower Decision Height (DH) and Runway Visual Range (RVR) for instrument approaches. The ﬂight instrument display symbology, including an earth referenced Flight Path Vector (FPV) and a Flight Path Angle Reference Cue (FPARC), provide enhanced control, position and path awareness via a continuous, intuitive indication to the pilot of the aircraft trajectory relative to the touchdown zone. The SVGS provides the following:

• Provide position assurance and approach guidance integrity monitoring with critical time to alert during approach to 150ft DH.

• Enable the pilot to maintain vertical and lateral ﬂight technical error (FTE) within deﬁned limits using path deviation information and command guidance, combined with an egocentric view of the runway environment.

• Enable the Pilot to determine the MAP.
