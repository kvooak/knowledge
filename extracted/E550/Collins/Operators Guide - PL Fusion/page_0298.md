MENUS AND DISPLAYS Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 MAP – Vertical Weather Pro Line Fusion® Avionics

N

NOTE

A white RADAR RANGE XXX NM message is shown and the weather radar overlay is removed if the weather radar range is a different range than the currently shown on-side range for more than 5 seconds. The XXX part of the message represents the actual range the weather radar is currently reporting as selected. This message can be removed by deselecting the weather radar from display.

### MAP – VERTICAL WEATHER Vertical weather allows the radar azimuth beams to perform ground clutter suppression and to perform a preliminary assessment of weather threats in range, azimuth, and altitude. This data is stored in memory and retrieved from the memory system in a variety of cut sets. The vertical data is extracted along any desired vertical path, i.e. along the current track, unwound Flight Management System (FMS) ﬂight plan, or along a crew commanded azimuth angle and displayed on the Vertical Situation Display (VSD) format.
