A green aircraft symbol shows on the map at the current aircraft position. If the animated NEXRAD image shows, a green aircraft symbol shows in the bottom right corner with a white circle and slash. If the FMS position or true heading are unavailable, a yellow aircraft symbol shows in the bottom right corner with a white circle and slash.

The XM GWX format can show the following information:

• NEXRAD

• SCIT tops
