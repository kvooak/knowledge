MENUS AND DISPLAYS Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 AFCS Flight Mode Annunciations Pro Line Fusion® Avionics

Flight Path Vector The Flight Path Vector (FPV) is shown on the attitude indicator as a green circle with small ticks at the top and sides. The FPV can be caged or uncaged. When the FPV is caged, the caged FPV and ghosted FPV symbols show. When the FPV is uncaged, only the uncaged FPV shows. The uncaged and ghosted FPV symbols indicate aircraft track and path angle, while the caged FPV indicates only path angle. The caged FPV shows as a green inverted T shape.

A conformal FPV is a solid circle, shown when the FPV is in the boundaries of the vertical deviation pointer, lateral deviation pointer, bank angle indicator, and the airspeed indicator. A non-conformal FPV is a dashed circle, shown when the FPV exceeds the boundaries.
