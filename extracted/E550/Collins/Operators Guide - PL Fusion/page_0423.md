Figure 7-5 Cursor Limitations

The cursor is prohibited from the ADI format. When the cursor contacts a prohibited area in the vertical direction, the cursor continues to move in the lateral direction with cursor left/right inputs. When the cursor contacts the edge of the display, the cursor continues to move along the edge of the display. When the cursor is on the edge of the display, only half of the cursor is in view.

Each CCP has a Double Stack Knob (DSK) which is used for various functions based on the active DU format. Refer to the DSK Icon heading in the GUI Elements section of this chapter for more information.

The enter/select switches on either side of the trackball housing perform a select function on a highlighted menu or dialog box item. The PUSH ENTER button in the center of the DSK also performs a select/enter function. If either of the buttons are pushed, the data is input into the selected ﬁeld and the and the menu is either closed or the cursor moves to the next logical place.
