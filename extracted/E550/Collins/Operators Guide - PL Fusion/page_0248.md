MENUS AND DISPLAYS Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 Tuning – HF Control Pro Line Fusion® Avionics

SELECTIONS:

Tune Tune the standby frequency by positioning the cursor over the standby frequency digits and using the DSK.

When an HF frequency is entered without a decimal point, the decimal point is placed assuming the lowest frequency. For example, an entry of 21 or 210 results in 2.1000, not 21.0000.

When a valid HF frequency is entered followed by an S or F, the resulting HF frequency is in Simplex mode.

When followed by an R or T, the resulting HF frequency is in Duplex mode, as either the Receive (R) or Transmit (T) frequency. For example, if R2.34 T21.7 is entered, 2.3400 is set as the receive frequency, and 21.7000 is set as the transmit frequency.

When followed by an E, the resulting HF frequency is in Emergency mode. When followed by an M, the resulting HF frequency is in Maritime mode.

Power Power is a multi-state toggle to set the HF transmit power to LO, MED, or HI.

Mode Mode is a multi-state toggle to select the operating mode of the HF radio to Simplex, Duplex, Emergency, or Maritime.

SQ SQ is a multi-state toggle to set the squelch level from zero (0) to 3.
