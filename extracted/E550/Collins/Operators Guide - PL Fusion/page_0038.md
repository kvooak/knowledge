OVERVIEW Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 System Description Pro Line Fusion® Avionics

Engine Indication and Crew Alert System (EICAS)

The EICAS is the interface between the avionics system and the other aircraft systems. The EICAS collects and concentrates engine and other subsystem information to show on the AFD. The EICAS sources engine and aircraft data from the engine Full Authority Digital Electronic Control (FADEC) and DCS for display purposes. The EICAS also interfaces with the Radio Interface Unit (RIU). The DCS drives the aircraft Crew Alerting System (CAS) voice messages and aural alerts and controls aural alert prioritization including CAS, TCAS, and TAWS. The RIU receives commands from the DCS to generate CAS voice messages and aural alerts that are broadcast over the ﬂight deck audio system. Processed EICAS data is supplied to the cross-side DCS channel, the ﬂight displays, and the RIU. Controls on the MKP are used to operate the CAS message list.

Enhanced Vision System (EVS) The optional Enhanced Vision System (EVS) produces a forward-looking image of the natural scene, including the approach lights of the runway, on the optional Head-Up Display (HUD) or AFD. The EVS gives the pilot increased visibility in low-light and obscured environments. The EVS consists of a Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) camera assembly, an EVS processor assembly, and a window assembly.
