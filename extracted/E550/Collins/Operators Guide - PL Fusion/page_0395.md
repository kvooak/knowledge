Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 MESSAGES AND ANNUNCIATORS Pro Line Fusion® Avionics Visual Annunciations

HSI: Heading Compare Flag

The HDG comparator ﬂag is a caution to the ﬂight crew that the headings being given by the AHRS may be in error on one side or the other.

ADI compares the heading from the on-side AHRS to the heading from the cross-side AHRS. When the heading compare function is active and the difference between the two headings is not within the predeﬁned limit, a boxed yellow HDG miscompare ﬂag is shown below the horizontal deviation scale. The ﬂag ﬂashes for 5 seconds and then changes to a steady-on state.

ADI: Horizontal Deviation Miscompare Flag

The horizontal deviation miscompare ﬂag shows when the pilot and copilot horizontal deviation bars do not show the same deviation. Refer to other sources to determine the correct indicator.

ADI : Lateral Navigation Compare Flag

The LNAV comparator ﬂag is a caution to the ﬂight crew that the FMS lateral navigation information being shown on the ADI may be in error on one side or the other.
