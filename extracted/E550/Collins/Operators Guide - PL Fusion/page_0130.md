MENUS AND DISPLAYS Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 ADI – Altitude Pro Line Fusion® Avionics

• Analog radio altitude is shown as a yellow hash line which comes into view at the bottom of the barometric altitude scale when the radio altitude is approximately 270 feet (the bottom of the barometric altitude scale is 270 feet below the current barometric altitude). The yellow hash line moves up to meet the 0 (zero) foot tic mark when the radio altitude is 0 (zero) feet.

• The digital readout of radio altitude is shown when the aircraft is within 2500 feet of the ground. The four-digit radio altitude readout is normally shown in green, with no leading zeros. When the RA MIN alert is in view, the readout changes color to yellow.

MIN RA/BARO Readout

The MIN RA/BARO digital readout is shown to the left of the BARO pressure setting readout next to the altitude scale. The MIN RA/BARO readout is the current active Decision Height (DH) or Minimum Descent Altitude (MDA). Radio Altitude Minimum (RA MIN) is Above Ground Level (AGL) and BARO MIN is Mean Sea Level (MSL) altitude. MIN RA and MIN BARO are mutually exclusive. Selecting RA deselects BARO, selecting BARO deselects RA.

• RA MIN readout is automatically shown when RA is selected. An active RA MIN displays to the bottom left of the ALT tape as XXXX, where XXXX is the set RA MIN value.
