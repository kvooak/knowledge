MENUS AND DISPLAYS Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 HSI Format Pro Line Fusion® Avionics

• A lateral deviation/cross-track distance bar moves to the left and right of the aircraft symbol to indicate the position of the course/track relative to the aircraft. The bar shows lateral deviation that is indicated when the NAV source is VOR or LOC and cross-track distance when the NAV source is FMS. The magnitude of the course deviation or cross-track distance is measured against the lateral deviation/cross-track distance scale.

• The lateral deviation/cross-track distance scale is shown perpendicular to and intersects the lateral deviation/cross-track distance bar. The scale has markings of two white dots to the left and two white dots to the right of the center line. The lateral deviation/cross-track distance scaling is as follows:

• VOR – One dot deﬂection equals 5 degrees of deviation from centerline.

• FMS provides variable scaling based on the ﬂight phase: Terminal area (31NM radius around origin and destination airport) 2 dots equals 1.0 NM.

• FMS Enroute - 2 dots equals 2.0 NM Approach - 2 dots equals 0.3 NM LPV approaches have angular deviation.
