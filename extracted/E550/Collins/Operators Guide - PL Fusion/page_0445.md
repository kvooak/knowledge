### DU MEMORIZED CONFIGURATIONS

The memorized conﬁgurations function provides controls to select user-speciﬁed DU conﬁgurations. The memorized conﬁgurations function provides nine user-speciﬁed memorized conﬁgurations. The memorized conﬁgurations function is accessed by pushing the MEM and numeric keys on the MKP. There are nine total conﬁgurations available: three OEM and six crew selectable. All four DU panels must be operational, and the DISPLAY SELECT switch on the RSP can not be in the OFF position to use the memorized conﬁgurations function. If the MEM key is pushed while these conditions are not true, a SELECTION INACTIVE message displays on the on-side HSI.

• Memorized Conﬁguration Content: Each memorized conﬁguration retains the following items:

• All selected window formats and sizes for each DU.

• PFD and HSI conﬁgurations.

• Map formats and overlays.

• Synoptic and CNS window formats.
