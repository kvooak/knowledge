Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 OVERVIEW Pro Line Fusion® Avionics System Description

#### COMPONENTS

Air Data System (ADS) The Air Data System (ADS) supplies processed air data to the Automatic Flight Control System (AFCS), Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS), and navigation systems. The ADS is made up of four Air Data Smart Probes (ADSP), pilot and copilot side pitot and static probes and pilot and copilot side temperature sensors. The four ADS are functionally isolated, and each acts as a separate air data subsystem. The ADS receives pitot and static air pressure and air temperature inputs from the aircraft sensors. The ADS processes the raw data, then sends digital air data to various aircraft systems that use air data inputs. Processed air data provided by the ADS includes: uncorrected pressure altitude, total and static pressure, vertical speed, airspeed, Mach, maximum airspeed/Mach, true airspeed, total air temperature, static air temperature, and International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) delta temperature. Air data from the third and the cross-side air data subsystems can be selected to drive on-side systems in the event of an on-side air data failure when the aircraft is on the ground. When airborne, air data reversion is automatic or can be selected by the pilot.
