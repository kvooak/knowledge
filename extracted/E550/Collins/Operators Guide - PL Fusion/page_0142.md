• F – shown when ﬂaps are extended. The speed is calculated based on aircraft weight, engine status, ﬂap position, initial takeoff or missed approach, and icing conditions.

• Flap Extension (VFE) – shown when it is safe to lower the ﬂaps. Indicated by a green dot on the right of the airspeed tape. The speed is calculated based on aircraft weight, engine status, ﬂap position, initial takeoff or missed approach, and icing conditions.
