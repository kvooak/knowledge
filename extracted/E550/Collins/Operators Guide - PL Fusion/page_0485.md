Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 AFCS OPERATION Pro Line Fusion® Avionics Flight Guidance Transfer

pushed. Pushing a FD button on the FCP selects or deselects the FD on both pilot and copilot DU. Push the FD button to select the FD in basic Pitch and Roll Hold modes. The FD is selected upon lateral or vertical mode selection with the AP not engaged (AP inverse video red). Both Flight Directors are selected upon:

• AP engagement (AP in green).

• Go Around (GA) mode selection.

• Takeoff mode selection.

The FG application generates steering commands that are presented by the FD on the ADI display when pitch and roll are both valid. Steering commands are generated by the coupled-side FCSA when the Flight Directors are dependent. Steering commands are generated by the on-side FCSA when the Flight Directors are independent. Steering commands are independent when APPR mode is active and GS is the vertical mode. The Flight Director Commands are independent when Approach 2 ILS mode is active.

Push the on-side FD button on the FCP to deselect both FD.

NOTE

Deselection of a FD is inhibited on the coupled side while autopilot is engaged, GA is active, TO is active, or APPR is active.

The FD comes into view and system mode messages are shown on the displays when a FD is selected. The FD steering commands are available to be coupled to the AP.

### FLIGHT GUIDANCE TRANSFER

The coupled-side ﬂight guidance channel can be selected to the pilot-side or copilot-side. The coupled-side ﬂight guidance channel drives the AP and both Flight Directors when ﬂight guidance is operating in the dependent mode. Flight guidance operates in the dependent mode for all lateral and vertical modes except precision approach (APPR mode is active). When the precision approach mode is active, ﬂight guidance operates in the independent mode. Flight Directors are only independent in Approach 2 ILS mode. When ﬂight guidance is operating in the independent mode, guidance from the coupled side drives the AP, pilot-side ﬂight guidance drives the pilot-side FD, and copilot-side ﬂight guidance drives the copilot-side FD.
