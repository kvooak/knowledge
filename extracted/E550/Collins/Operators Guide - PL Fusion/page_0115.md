Slip/Skid A white trapezoid slip/skid indicator shown at the base of the roll pointer is used to indicate lateral accelerations. The slip/skid indicator uses the base of the roll pointer as its reference. A displacement the width of the trapezoid from the base of the roll pointer is approximately equivalent to a one-ball displacement on a conventional inclinometer. The slip/skid indicator moves with the roll pointer in a bank.
