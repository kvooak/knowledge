MENUS AND DISPLAYS Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 ADI – Altitude Pro Line Fusion® Avionics

• The preselect altitude bug is shown on the right side of the altitude scale. The bug is cyan, and is shown on the scale at an altitude value that corresponds to the preselect altitude setting readout that is shown above the altitude scale.

Preselect Altitude Alert

The PSA alert notiﬁes the pilot that the aircraft barometric altitude is approaching the PSA. The PSA readout ﬂashes in cyan and the ﬂight deck aural warning sounds when the barometric altitude is within the acquisition limit. The readout stops ﬂashing when the barometric altitude is within the deviation limit.

• The PSA readout ﬂashes in cyan and the aural warning sounds when the aircraft barometric altitude closes to within ±1000 feet of the PSA.

• The PSA readout stops ﬂashing when the aircraft barometric altitude closes to within ±200 feet of the PSA.

• The PSA readout changes to yellow, ﬂashes, and the aural warning sounds when the aircraft barometric altitude exceeds ±200 feet of the PSA after it has been within ±200 feet of the PSA.

• The readout changes back to cyan when the aircraft barometric altitude returns to within ±200 feet of the PSA, or if a new PSA is selected.
