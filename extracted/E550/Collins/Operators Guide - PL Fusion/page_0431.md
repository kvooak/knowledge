• A list is a series of data organized vertically. If the list contains more items than can be shown in one list window, then scrolling controls are provided. Scrolling can be accomplished with the DSK or pushbuttons to the right of the list.

• The DU pushbutton displays a control that represents an action. Position the cursor over the pushbutton and use the select buttons on the trackball housing, the PUSH SELECT button in the center of the DSK, or the ENTER button on the MKP to select the pushbutton.

• The DU paging icon provides the user with a method to page through available items. The user pages through the available items by turning the DSK on the CCP or the PREV and NEXT buttons on the MKP.
