Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 AFCS OPERATION Pro Line Fusion® Avionics Introduction

## AFCS OPERATION

### INTRODUCTION

The Automatic Flight Control System (AFCS) comprises the following functions:

• Flight Director (FD)

• Autopilot (AP)

• Autothrottle (AT).

The AFCS has its functions distributed in the Avionics System, Flight Controls System (FCS) and Propulsion System. Both FD and AP functions are primarily computed by the Autopilot Flight Director Guidance System (AFGS). The AP/FBW interface is part of the autopilot system which is implemented inside the Flight Control Computers (FCC). The AP/FBW interface will receive the autopilot commands, vertical and lateral, from both ﬂight guidance applications.

N

NOTE

The AFCS provides guidance with or without the autopilot engaged.

N

NOTE

The pilot setting of the Active Target Speed Readout with the Target Speed Control has priority over control from the FMS and AFCS.

N

NOTE

This AFCS references the Embraer Touch Control Steering (TCS) which is also known as Flight Director Sync (SYNC) or Control Wheel Steering (CWS).

The Flight Control Panel (FCP) hosts controls for engagement/ disengagement of Autopilot (AP), Autothrottle (AT) and Flight Director (FD), reference and mode selection, and course selection.
