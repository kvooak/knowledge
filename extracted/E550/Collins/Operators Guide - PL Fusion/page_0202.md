NOTE

If more CAS messages exist in the CAS message window than can be displayed, EICAS will displayed a small colored triangle with the number of additional out of view messages. The color of the triangle will be associated with the type of CAS message that is out of view. For example, a yellow triangle indicates that additional caution messages are out of view

### SYNOPTIC FORMAT The Synoptic format provides graphical representation of aircraft systems to the aircrew. Each Synoptic page is composed of graphical features that represent the aircraft system components, architecture, ﬂow, and/or status. Synoptic graphical features consist of ﬂow lines, valves, outline boxes, digital readouts, and system components (for example, ﬂight controls, landing gear, pump, ﬁlter, ﬂuid reservoir, etc.). Color change and/or change in the graphical appearance are used to indicate the status of a Synoptic graphical feature.

SELECTIONS:

Flow Lines Flow lines are static graphical features that are used to connect the system components and typically reﬂect the upstream component or feature status. No ﬂow is shown as a single white line, normal ﬂow is shown as a single green line, and undetermined ﬂow is shown as a yellow dashed line.
