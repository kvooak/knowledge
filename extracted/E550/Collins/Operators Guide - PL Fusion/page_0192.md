GCS The Ground Clutter Suppression (GCS) control is used during automatic operation to select the GCS feature. GCS is only available in the AUTO mode of operation. When active, GCS removes approximately 98 percent of ground clutter. GCS ON is the default setting; GCS will automatically turn ON 30 seconds after it is turned OFF.

TILT Use the inner knob on the DSK to select the value of the WXR tilt. Tilt is selectable from +15 degrees to -15 degrees. This option is not available when CTRL is set to AUTO.

GAIN Use the outer knob on the DSK to select the value of the WXR gain. Values are from +3 to −3.

TIP

Return the gain to NORM to make sure the radar is showing the proper returns.
