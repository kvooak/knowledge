Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 MENUS AND DISPLAYS Pro Line Fusion® Avionics Map – Vertical Situation Display

Figure 5-121 Map – VSD (Approach)

Approach data shows on the VSD as a Final Approach Fix (FAF) and approach feather. Display of vertical ﬂight plan data is inhibited between the FAF and the runway. A level-segment from the FAF to the Missed Approach Waypoint (MAPW) shows to provide guidance in the event that geometric vertical guidance (ILS, LDA with glideslope, RNAV/LPV) is not captured. The transition to geometric vertical guidance requires selection of the APPR key on the FCP. If the ﬂight plan shown on the VSD has a precision approach procedure, a P displays on the FAF line.

Figure 5-122 Map – VSD (Departure Obstacle)

Departure data on the VSD can include TOLD obstacles. When the pilot enters a valid TOLD obstacle deﬁnition in the FMS, a TOLD obstacle symbol shows if the obstacle is in range.
