OVERVIEW – SYSTEM COMPONENTS Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 System Description Pro Line Fusion® Avionics

Radio Interface Unit (RIU) The Radio Interface Unit (RIU) performs audio management, data concentration, and radio control pass-through functions for all of the voice and navigation radios installed in the aircraft. The RIU also provides the aural alerts as part of the Crew Alerting System (CAS) function of the EICAS. The RIU prioritizes between CAS, TAWS, and TCAS tone and voice alerts and then passes those alerts to the ﬂight crew through the aircraft audio system. Two RIU are installed.

Reversion Switch Panel (RSP)

The Reversion Switch Panel (RSP) enables the crew to control the de-selection of graphical radio tuning sources, EICAS positioning, and reversion of attitude and air data sources. The two panels also provide brightness controls for each individual DU as well as the ability to turn a DU off. The RSP also provides a backup method of tuning the communications radios to 121.5MHz.
