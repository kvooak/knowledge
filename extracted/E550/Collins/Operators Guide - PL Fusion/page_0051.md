Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 OVERVIEW – SYSTEM COMPONENTS Pro Line Fusion® Avionics Introduction

## OVERVIEW – SYSTEM COMPONENTS

### INTRODUCTION

This chapter provides a simpliﬁed block diagram of the baseline conﬁguration avionics system architecture and descriptions of each of the major system components that are necessary for the operation of the Rockwell Collins Pro Line Fusion Avionics system.

### SYSTEM DESCRIPTION The Pro Line Fusion avionics system is a fully integrated avionics system. Four Adaptive Flight Display (AFD) units (also known as a Display Unit (DU)) provide display and control functions for the Automatic Flight Control System (AFCS), ﬂight instruments, navigation subsystems, hazard avoidance subsystems, Radio Management System (RMS), Onboard Maintenance System (OMS), and the optional Head-Up Guidance System (HGS). The AFD are controlled with the Cursor Control Panel (CCP), Display Control Panel (DCP), Multifunction Keyboard Panel (MKP). Additional control functions are provided by the installer-supplied controls and switches. The central feature of the avionics system is the Integrated Processing System (IPS). The IPS provides a central data collection and distribution point for the avionics systems.

#### KEY OPERATING FEATURES

• The components within the avionics system communicate primarily with Avionics Full Duplex (AFDX) using and ARINC 429 buses.

• The central feature of the avionics system is the IPS. The IPS is broken down into a left and right Integrated Processing Cabinet (IPC) for redundancy. Each IPC is a housing that provides power, environmental control, lightning, and HIRF protection for a number of Common Computing Module (CCM)s. These modules are loaded with the software that provides the avionics functions, FMS, SVS, IFIS, eCDU, AMM, TAWS, and OMS.

• Data from external systems is provided to the IPS for use by internal modules and for distribution to other external systems.
