MENUS AND DISPLAYS Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 ADI – Airspeed Pro Line Fusion® Avionics

The airspeed readout changes color to red for an Overspeed Alert or a minimum speed (VMIN) cue.

Mach Display The Mach mode is selects the target speed as MACH or IAS when the aircraft climbs through 32 500 feet at 0.40 Mach or greater. The Mach mode is not selectable when the current Mach is less than 0.40. The Mach display consists of a vertical Mach scale and a ﬁxed-position pointer. A readout of the current Mach is shown inside the pointer. The range of the scale is 0.40 to 0.998 Mach.

The Mach readout changes color to yellow for an Overspeed Pre-Alert or a minimum maneuver speed (VMM) cue.

The Mach readout changes color to red for an Overspeed Alert or a minimum speed (VMIN) cue.

Airspeed Trend Vector

The airspeed trend vector is a vertical, variable-length white line that is shown to the right of the airspeed scale. The tip of the airspeed trend vector points to the projected airspeed in approximately 10 seconds at the present rate of acceleration or deceleration. The airspeed trend vector is drawn up or down the airspeed scale from the current airspeed (the center of the ﬁxed airspeed pointer). The airspeed trend vector is shown when the aircraft has been airborne for at least 3 seconds.
