Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 CONTROLS AND INDICATORS Pro Line Fusion® Avionics Remote Avionics Interface Switches

### REMOTE AVIONICS INTERFACE SWITCHES

The remote avionics-related interface switches include all remote-mounted, installer-supplied, cockpit-located switches that interface with the Pro Line Fusion Avionics System to provide control input functions.

CALLOUTS:

Touch Control Steering

OEM-provided Touch Control Steering (TCS) buttons are located on each control stick. The TCS button enables the pilot to maneuver the airplane without disconnecting the autopilot control or to adjust the FPV vertical location to the current aircraft attitude. Pushing the TCS button causes the aileron and elevator servo clutches to release while the switch remains pushed, and it causes the active vertical ﬂight director references to synchronize to current values. When on descent, pushing the TCS button places a TCS Trim bug on the airspeed indicator and illuminates a green TCS TRIM advisory under the airspeed indicator.

Autopilot Discon- nect Switches

OEM-provided Autopilot (AP) disconnect switches are located on each control stick. The AP disconnect switch disengages the autopilot when pushed.

Autothrottle Discon- nect Switch

The AT may be disconnected by AT disconnect switches which are located on both throttle levers.

Takeoff/Go Around (TOGA) Switch

A TOGA switch is mounted on the outboard side of each of the throttle levers.
