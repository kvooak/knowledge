Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 OVERVIEW – SYSTEM COMPONENTS Pro Line Fusion® Avionics System Description

Air Trafﬁc Con- trol Transpon- der (TDR)

The Transponder (TDR) provides aircraft identiﬁcation and altitude reporting for the air trafﬁc control system. The transponder features the familiar 4096 possible Mode A code selections and selectable Mode C altitude reporting. Mode S datalink and diversity reception, features that are required for TCAS II operation, are also provided. The TDR is also equipped for ﬂight Identiﬁcation (ID) elementary and enhanced surveillance. One TDR is installed, and a second ATC TDR function is incorporated in the TSS. Both the TDR and the TSS provide ADS-B Out functionality.

Trafﬁc Surveil- lance Sys- tem (TSS) Transponder

The Trafﬁc Surveillance System (TSS) transponder interrogates nearby Mode C and Mode S transponders and analyzes their replies to identify potential collision threats. The TSS advises the pilot when to climb, descend, or maintain altitude to avoid passing too close to or colliding with threat aircraft. When an intruder aircraft is also equipped with TCAS, the TSS coordinates avoidance maneuvers through the datalink capability of the Mode S Transponders. TSS generated collision avoidance visual ﬂy-to directives are provided by path cues on the AFD attitude displays. TCAS operating and fault messages are also shown on the AFD. TSS generated intruder symbology can be shown on any of the ﬂight displays. One TSS is installed.
