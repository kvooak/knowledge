• A readout is used to show information that the operator may not edit. Readouts usually have a legend, a unit of measurement, and the data readout.

• A status bar indicates the real-time progress towards completion of an activity, for example, software loading.

• A subformat link is used to access a subformat when selected.

### DU WINDOW ALLOCATION

Each DU has four conﬁgurable windows. Each quarter window may be independently conﬁgured, or a vertical half window format may be conﬁgured. The combination of quarter and half window formats is controlled by controls on the CCP, MKP, or the DU format selection menu. The outboard halves of DU1 and DU3 are referred to as the Primary Flight Display (PFD). The inboard halves of DU1 and DU3 are referred to as the Multifunction Flight Display (MFD). The PFD conﬁguration may be changed with the PFD FULL/HALF button on the PFD Format menu on the HSI. The MFD may be conﬁgured in the same manner as any MFW.

The default conﬁguration for the PFD is a full screen Attitude Director Indicator (ADI) above, and a full screen Horizontal Situation Indicator (HSI) below. For the half screen conﬁguration the ADI and HSI take the outboard half of the pilot and copilot DU and a MFW takes the inside half.

When EICAS is reverted on the full screen PFD the EICAS is put on either side of a 1/6 size HSI, EIS on the left and CAS on the right. If
