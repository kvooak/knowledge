Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 MESSAGES AND ANNUNCIATORS Pro Line Fusion® Avionics Visual Annunciations

The altitude comparator is disabled if an ADS is failed or if a common air data source is selected.

ADI: Autothrottle Disengage Caution

#### .

The ATT comparator ﬂag is a caution to the ﬂight crew that the attitude being shown on the ADI may be in error on one side or the other.

ADI compares the attitude from the on-side AHRS to the heading from the cross-side AHRS. Attitude miscompare occurs when the both pitch and roll miscompares are active (it replaces the PIT and ROL ﬂags). When the heading compare function is active and the difference between the two headings is not within the predeﬁned limit, a boxed yellow ATT miscompare ﬂag is shown below the ﬂight mode annunciation display. The ﬂag ﬂashes for 5 seconds and then changes to a steady-on state.

ADI: Flight Path Vector Miscompare Flag

The FPV Miscompare ﬂag shows when the FPV horizontal or vertical difference between any PFD exceeds the FPV comparator limit.

• Radio altitude at or above 600 feet – 4.46 degrees.

• The FPV comparator tolerance decreases as a function of decreasing radio altitude when radio altitude < 600 feet and > 200 feet.
