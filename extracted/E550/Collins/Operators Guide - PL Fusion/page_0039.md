Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 OVERVIEW Pro Line Fusion® Avionics System Description

Flight Manage- ment System (FMS)

The Flight Management System (FMS) provides lateral and vertical ﬂight plan point-to-point navigation using multiple navigation sensors. The FMS consists of two Flight Management System Application (FMSA) programs hosted in two separate IPC modules, and two Global Positioning System (GPS) sensors. The system generates lateral and vertical steering commands for use by the AFCS and EFIS. The ADS, NAV receivers, and Distance Measuring Equipment (DME) sensors supply data to the FMS. The FMS uses position data from the navigation sensors (GPS, VHF Omnidirectional Range (VOR), Attitude/Heading Reference System (AHRS), and DME) and sensor data from the AHRS and ADS, along with the active ﬂight plan and its own data base information, to generate lateral and vertical ﬂight-plan-based navigation solutions.

Head-Up Guid- ance System (HGS)

The optional Head-Up Guidance System (HGS) is an electronic Head-Up Display (HUD) that generates and projects ﬂight information in the pilot’s forward ﬁeld of view. The system shows primary ﬂight and navigation data that overlay the outside scene in an accurate conformal relationship. The HGS consists of the Pilot Display Unit (PDU), the Power Supply Unit (PSU), and the HGS application software.
