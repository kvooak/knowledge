OVERVIEW Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 System Description Pro Line Fusion® Avionics

Automatic Flight Control System (AFCS)

The Automatic Flight Control System (AFCS) consists of a dual-channel Flight Director (FD), Primary Flight Control Computers (PFCC) providing the Autopilot (AP), automatic pitch trim and Yaw Damper (YD) functions, and Autothrottle (AT). The AFCS consists of two Flight Control System Application (FCSA) hosted on each channel of the Data Concentrator Module Cabinet (DMC), a Flight Control Panel (FCP), dual Touch Control Steering (TCS) buttons and dual autopilot disconnect/stick priority buttons on the side-stick controls. Lateral and vertical modes selected by the pilot are used by the AFCS to generate steering commands that are sent to the PFCCs and shown on the PFD Flight Directors. The PFCCs then position the ﬂight controls to ﬂy the commanded lateral and vertical path. The PFCCs provide full time control of the rudder to provide the yaw damper functions of roll damping and turn coordination. The Autothrottle feature provides commands to position the throttle levers. The EFIS Adaptive Flight Display (AFD) provides interfaces with and displays indications for AFCS functions. Other inputs to the AFCS include those from the ADS, Navigation (NAV) receivers, Engine Indication and Crew Alert System (EICAS), and the Data Concentration System (DCS).
