Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 OVERVIEW Pro Line Fusion® Avionics System Description

Electronic Flight Instrument Sys- tem (EFIS)

The Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS) is a multicolor, ﬂight instrument display and control system made up of four AFD, two each of a Multifunction Keyboard Panel (MKP), Cursor Control Panel (CCP), Reversion Switch Panel (RSP), and Display Control Panel (DCP). The EFIS provides display and control functions for all primary ﬂight/navigation information, installed communications, hazard avoidance, and the EICAS. The EFIS is made up of a pilot-side and copilot-side system. Each side is functionally and physically isolated from each other and is capable of functioning as a completely independent subsystem. The display portion of the system is made up of four AFD. Each display can be subdivided into quarter, half, or full screen formats. In normal operation, the displays show the Attitude Director Indicator (ADI), Horizontal Situation Indicator (HSI), and Engine Indication and Crew Alert System (EICAS) formats, in addition to selectable information formats. The CCP provides display control inputs to each of the displays for both the pilot and copilot through an on-screen cursor. The CCP cursor manipulates on-screen Graphic/User Interface (GUI) display and information controls. The MKP provides alphanumeric keyboard entry with a scratchpad display and specialized control keys. The RSP is used to control display dimming and reversion. The DCP contains push buttons to select overlays, select NAV sources, BARO settings, and weather radar range/tilt. The IPS and DCS are used to gather and concentrate the data shown on the EFIS. The AFD is also referred to as the Display Unit (DU).
