Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 MENUS AND DISPLAYS Pro Line Fusion® Avionics ADI – Attitude

TCAS RA Path Cues

The TCAS Resolution Advisory (RA) path cues are shown on the ADI attitude indicator. The path cues advise the pilot of the path attitude that is necessary to satisfy a vertical RA. RA cues are issued by the TCAS computer when aircraft corrective maneuvering is required in order to avoid a potential collision. The path cues are shown as red avoidance zones and green ﬂy to zones. When the path cues are being shown, the FD steering commands and FMS Vertical Speed Required pointer are removed. A yellow NO ATT RA message is shown in the TCAS data ﬁeld when RA path cues cannot be computed or if path data is not in view on the ADI. The path cues are disabled when an excessive attitude condition exists. When any data required to compute path cues is invalid, the path cues are removed. Two types of RA cues can be issued by the TCAS computer: preventive and corrective.
