Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 MENUS AND DISPLAYS Pro Line Fusion® Avionics EICAS Format

• Status – Status messages are the lowest priority, and display in white.

New CAS messages ﬂash until acknowledged by the Master Warning/Caution reset switch. If multiple similar messages are active, they may be shown as a single collector message. For example, if both a left and right component fail, the CAS message list may show L R XXX FAIL instead of separate left and right fail messages.

The CAS message list shows 10 CAS messages when in Compressed mode, or 12 CAS messages in Normal mode.

If an associated checklist is available, a check box shows to the left of the CAS message. When the associated checklist is complete, a check mark is shown in the check box.

Place the cursor in the CAS window and turn the upper knob of the DSK to advance the CAS message list one message, if more than 10 messages (compressed) or 12 messages (normal) are shown.

Annunciators may display at the bottom of the CAS message list. When an annunciator shows, one less CAS message is shown.
