Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 OVERVIEW – SYSTEM COMPONENTS Pro Line Fusion® Avionics System Description

Global Posi- tioning Sys- tem (GPS) Re- ceiver/Proces- sor

The Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver receives navigation data from a constellation of GPS satellites. The GPS processor uses these inputs to generate precise position, velocity, and time data that can be shown on the ﬂight displays and for use by the navigation and hazard avoidance subsystems. Two GPS receivers are installed.

HF Coupler (Optional) The High Frequency (HF) antenna coupler quickly matches the power ampliﬁer in the HF COM receiver-transmitter to the antenna to maximize the radiated power. The HF antenna coupler has the ability to learn and store tuning data for 99 preset channels as well as storing the last 50 manually-tuned frequencies. Two HF couplers are installed.
