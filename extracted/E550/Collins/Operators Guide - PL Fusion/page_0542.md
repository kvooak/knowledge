NOTE

Refer to Rockwell Collins ATN and FANS Harmonized CPDLC Application Operator’s Guide (CPN 523-0822822) for more information covering CPDLC/ADS-C. Refer to Rockwell Collins publication Corporate Datalink System CMU-4000/RIU-40X0 (CPN 523-0790499), or the Rockwell Collins publication Regional Datalink System CMU-4XXX/RIU-40X0 (CPN 523-0818402) for more information on the Air Operations Center (AOC), Air Trafﬁc Services (ATS), or technical functions of the Datalink.

### COMPONENTS

CPDLC equipment includes: Radio Interface Unit (RIU), emulated Control Display Unit (eCDU), VHF Data Link (VDL), and printer (if installed). The user can also access the ATS and ATN functions using the Multipurpose Control Display Unit (MCDU) Menu. FANS may also use the Iridium Satellite Communications (SATCOM) system, if installed. The activation of the optional ATN function requires an Encrypted Access Key (EAK) for both the Aircraft Personality Module (APM) and RIU. The activation of the optional FANS function requires an EAK for the APM.

### CONTROLS AND INDICATORS

The MFD is the primary interface through the CPDLC/ADS-C page for the ﬂight crew. Function keys shown on the graphics in this appendix are visually similar to most MFD displays and are generic in nature. Display pages used in the graphics in this appendix are visually similar between each MFD and are generic in nature. Data is automatically synchronized with other MFD. The Datalink CPDLC/ADS-C layer has the capability to be active on two displays simultaneously. When the Data Link Communication Application (DLCA) is unable to communicate with the ARINC 661 Graphics Server (AGS) display via the Aeronautical Radio, INCorporated (ARINC) 661 protocol, it will display CPDLC NOT AVAILABLE. Refer to Rockwell Collins ATN and FANS Harmonized CPDLC Application Operator’s Guide (CPN 523-0822822) for more information.
