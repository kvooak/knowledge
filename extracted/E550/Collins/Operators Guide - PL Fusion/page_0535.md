## APPENDIX B

### TCAS AURALS

The TCAS system gives an aural RA over the aircraft ﬂight deck audio system or an independent speaker system in addition to the shown RA. If the TCAS senses that the other aircraft is not responding in the planned manner, it issues opposite corrective commands. For example, if the TCAS issues a descent but the other aircraft also descends, the TCAS issues a corrective climb command. The following table lists the TCAS aurals and gives a brief description of each.
