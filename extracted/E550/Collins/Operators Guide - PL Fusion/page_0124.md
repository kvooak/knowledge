MENUS AND DISPLAYS Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 ADI – Altitude Pro Line Fusion® Avionics

Metric Altitude Readout

Metric altitude shows in a digital readout below the barometric altitude readout. Metric altitude shows with 5 meter resolution, up to 5 digits in small text, followed by a gray M. No leading zeros show, and negative metric altitude is indicated by a green negative sign. Metric altitude display is selected with the ALT knob on the FCP.

Altitude Trend Vec- tor

The altitude trend vector is a white thermometer style display that shows the magnitude and direction of vertical acceleration. The altitude trend vector moves upward for a positive vertical speed, and downward for a negative vertical speed. The altitude trend vector is computed to predict the altitude the aircraft achieves (assuming constant velocity) in 10 seconds, up to ±500 feet on the altitude scale.

Preselect Altitude The Preselect Altitude (PSA) setting is capable of being set from zero (0) to 55 000 feet. The PSA is shown in feet when a nonstandard barometric pressure is set. If the standard barometric is set, the PSA is shown as FLXXX. The equivalent metric preselect altitude value can also be selected to be shown on the ADI. Automatic changing of the digital preselect altitude display (ﬂashing, color change, or with a yellow underline) provides visual cues of altitude alert or failure conditions. If the DU detects that the PSA is different from the other PFD, a yellow line is placed under the cyan numbers of the PSA.
