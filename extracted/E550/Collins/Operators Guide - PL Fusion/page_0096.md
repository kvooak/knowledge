CONTROLS AND INDICATORS Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 Remote Avionics Interface Switches Pro Line Fusion® Avionics

• Takeoff mode is selected by pushing one of the TOGA switches when the aircraft is on the ground. In the lateral axis commands are generated to maintain wings level. In the vertical axis commands are generated to maintain a reference airspeed, either FMS or manual. When in Takeoff mode, the AT sets takeoff thrust or ﬂex thrust. • Go Around mode is selected by pushing one of the TOGA switches when the aircraft is in the air. In the lateral axis commands are generated to hold the heading existing when the TOGA switch is pushed. In the vertical axis commands are generated to maintain a reference airspeed, either FMS or manual. When in Go Around mode, the AT sets go around thrust, equivalent to takeoff thrust. • Windshear Escape node is selected when the TOGA Control is selected and a TAWS Windshear warning is active. Windshear Escape mode takes into account pitch and airspeed to keep the aircraft ﬂying away from the ground in an adverse shear situation.

Trim Switches OEM-provided pitch trim switches are located on each control stick for the purpose of manually trimming the aircraft. The manual trim system is independent of the AFCS.
