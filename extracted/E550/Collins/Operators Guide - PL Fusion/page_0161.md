Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 MENUS AND DISPLAYS Pro Line Fusion® Avionics HSI Format

• The course/desired track readout displays CRS for a VOR or front course LOC source, B/C for a back course LOC source, DTK for a FMS desired track, and HDG for a FMS heading source.

• The TTG line is updated based on FMS calculation or DME calculation depending on the active NAV source.

• The distance display provides Nautical Miles (NM) distance information. The distance information is associated with the active NAV source, providing distance to the:

• Next waypoint for FMS.

• Station for VOR.

• Runway for LOC.

Course/Desired Track Pointer

The course/desired track pointer, to/from arrow, lateral deviation/cross-track distance bar, and scale are all shown for all NAV sources (FMS, VOR, and LOC). The course/track pointer is a wide single-bar arrow on the compass display. The pointer is a course pointer when VOR or LOC is the active NAV source, and a track pointer when the active NAV source is FMS. The pointer elements are shown in the same color as the active NAV source. The on-side course for non-FMS NAV sources is set on the FCP using the CRS knobs.
