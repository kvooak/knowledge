EXEC Execute Button

Pushing the EXEC button executes a Modiﬁed (MOD) ﬂight plan making it the Active (ACT) ﬂight plan. The light bar above the EXEC button illuminates when there is a modiﬁed ﬂight plan.

MEM Memorized Formats Button

The MEM button provides the ability to memorize the formats selected for each display in the ﬂight deck. Three conﬁgurations are set by the OEM and six conﬁgurations are user deﬁned. Each is recalled by selecting the MEM button followed by a numeric key (1-9). Flight deck display conﬁgurations are memorized by pushing and holding the MEM button for 3 seconds, followed by selection of the desired numeric key. The conﬁgurations can be memorized and recalled from either MKP. When the MEM button is selected, the MEM RECALL information box displays on the on-side PFD.

CLR/DEL Clear/Delete Button

The CLR/DEL button performs two functions, depending on whether there is data in the scratchpad.

When there is data in the scratchpad, pushing and immediately releasing the CLR/DEL button backspaces one character at a time, or pushing and momentarily holding the CLR/DEL button clears the entire scratchpad.
