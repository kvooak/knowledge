NEXT Next Button

The NEXT button is used to advance to the next page of the selected page sequence. When the NEXT button is pushed and the cursor is on the plan format, the map center is positioned at the next waypoint in the waypoint list.

←↑→↓ The MKP arrow keys provide an alternate to the CCP trackball for positioning the cursor on the selected display unit. Each key moves the cursor in the speciﬁed direction. Diagonal movement is possible by pushing two adjacent keys simultaneously. Pushing and immediately releasing an arrow key when the cursor is on a graphical control (Data entry ﬁeld, button, etc.) jumps the cursor to the closest graphical control in the desired direction. Pushing and immediately releasing an arrow key when it is not on a graphical control moves the cursor a ﬁxed distance in the desired direction. A push and hold of an arrow key slews the cursor in the desired direction until the key is released.
