OVERVIEW Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 System Description Pro Line Fusion® Avionics

Radio Manage- ment System (RMS)

The Radio Management System (RMS) contains the radios that are used for voice communications, VOR and Instrument Landing System (ILS) navigation, distance measurement, Automatic Direction Finder (ADF) navigation, TCAS/Mode S communication, and operation within the Air Trafﬁc Control (ATC) environment. The RMS is a dual-independent system made up of pilot and copilot side radios and sensors. The Embraer aircraft comes standard with two RIU, two (third optional) VHF COM transceivers conﬁgured with 8.33 kHz channel spacing (with one or optionally two datalink capable COM transceivers), two VOR/ILS/MKR NAV receivers, one (second optional) DME transceiver, two optional ADF receivers, two optional High Frequency (HF) COM subsystems, one ATC Mode-S diversity transponder with Flight Identiﬁcation (ID) and Automatic Dependent Surveillance (ADS)-B out, and one ATC Mode-S diversity transponder with ADS-B out incorporated into the Trafﬁc Surveillance System (TSS). Additional optional equipment includes a Satellite Communications (SATCOM) radio system. The RMS provides digital radio data to the EFIS, navigation systems, and hazard avoidance systems through the IPS and system bus structure. Each RMS subsystem (pilot and copilot) is functionally isolated and acts as a stand-alone subsystem. Each RMS subsystem can control the cross-side radios/sensors in the event of a control or display failure.
