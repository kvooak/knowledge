Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 OVERVIEW Pro Line Fusion® Avionics System Description

Terrain Aware- ness Warning System (TAWS)

The Terrain Awareness Warning System (TAWS) provides the pilot with increased situational awareness that can reduce the possibility of accidents associated with controlled ﬂight into terrain. The TAWS is comprised of a TAWS Processing Module (TPM) and a CCM housed in the right IPC. The TAWS is effectively three independent systems: a ground proximity warning system, a terrain database and display system, and a reactive windshear warning system. The TAWS uses geographic position and altitude data for the aircraft and an internal terrain database to predict potential conﬂicts between the aircraft ﬂight-path and terrain. Visual and audio warnings of excessive deviation below an ILS glideslope or LPV, severe windshear conditions, altitude callouts during ﬁnal approach, alerts for descent below Decision Height (DH), and alerts for excessive bank angle are available. The TAWS uses its own worldwide database along with speciﬁc aircraft information from the DCS, position data from the FMS, GPS, and navigation receivers, altitude data from the radio altimeter, attitude and heading data from the AHRS, air data information from the ADS, and Angle Of Attack (AOA) data from the DCS. Control inputs are from the CCP and MKP, and an OEM control panel. The system outputs aural alerts over the ﬂight deck audio system and visual alerts, graphic displays of conﬂicting terrain, terrain elevation, caution and warning messages, and mode and status data to the ﬂight displays through the IPS and the system bus structure.
