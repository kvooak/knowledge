Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 OVERVIEW Pro Line Fusion® Avionics System Description

Information Man- agement System (IMS)

The Information Management System (IMS) provides backup storage and conﬁguration management of avionics system application software, databases, tables, and documents. The IMS includes USB ports, Ethernet ports, internal storage (solid state drive), a commercial standard Wireless Fidelity (WiFi) interface and cellular network communications capability. The IMS hosts the onboard data loader for data loading, eFlight for ﬁle transfers and management, and the print server application for printing to the cockpit printer. Utilization and enablement of WiFi and cellular network requires a Rockwell Collins subscription service.

Lightning Detec- tion System (LDS) The non-Rockwell Collins Lightning Detection System (LDS) (L3 Communications Stormscope® WX-1000E Weather Mapping System, referred to as the LDS in this guide) maps electrical discharge activity (lightning) within 200 NM of the aircraft. The LDS is made up of one LDS processor and one antenna. The LDS-generated lightning symbology is available to show on the EFIS ﬂight displays. The LDS processor uses inputs from the antenna to calculate the azimuth and range of the electrical discharges in the area surrounding the aircraft. The LDS processor then generates lightning symbology and operating and fault messages that are shown on the ﬂight displays. The LDS graphic displays are selected with on-screen menus on the AFD. The LDS outputs lightning azimuth, range, intensity, and system mode/status data to the ﬂight displays through the IPS and system bus structure.
