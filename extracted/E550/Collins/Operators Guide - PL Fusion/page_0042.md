OVERVIEW Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 System Description Pro Line Fusion® Avionics

Multiscan™ Weather Radar System

The Multiscan™Weather Radar detects and locates precipitation-related weather and precipitation-related turbulence targets for the purpose of navigating around weather hazards, and provides fully automatic operation. The Multiscan™Weather Radar combines multiple radar scans at preselected tilt angles in order to detect weather at various ranges. The weather information is combined to provide an optimized weather picture regardless of aircraft altitude or range selected. The Multiscan™ Weather Radar can also be used to provide limited ground terrain information. The weather and map information can be overlaid on most of the navigation formats on any combination of ﬂight displays. The Multiscan™Weather Radar consists of a Receiver/Transmitter Antenna (RTA) assembly mounted in the nose of the aircraft. The RTA contains an antenna, Radio Frequency (RF) assembly, pedestal assembly, and base assembly. The RF assembly contains the receiver and transmitter. The pedestal contains tilt/scan motors and optical feedback switches. The base contains the power supply and signal processing circuits. Weather radar targets and mode messages are shown on the AFD. The Multiscan™Weather Radar is controlled by on-screen menus on the AFD. For more information, refer to the Rockwell Collins RTA-4100 Series MultiScan™Automatic Weather Radar Operator’s Guide (CPN 523-0816797).
