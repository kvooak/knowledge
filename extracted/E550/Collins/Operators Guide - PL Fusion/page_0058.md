Enhanced Vision Sys- tem (EVS) (Optional)

The optional Enhanced Vision System (EVS) produces a forward-looking image of the natural scene, including the approach lights of the runway, on the optional Head-Up Display (HUD) or AFD. The EVS gives the pilot increased visibility in low-light and obscured environments. The EVS consists of a Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR) camera assembly, an EVS processor assembly, and a window assembly.

The External Compensation Unit (ECU) stores aircraft-speciﬁc data for the Radio Interface Unit (RIU) datalink and the Trafﬁc Surveillance System (TSS). Two ECU are installed, with a third ECU if the optional third AHRS is installed.

Controls located on the FCP are also used to set the altitude, heading, airspeed, vertical speed, and path references.
