CNS Communications, Navigation, and Surveillance Quick Access Key

If a Controller/Pilot Datalink Communication (CPDLC) message requiring pilot interaction is available, pushing the Communications, Navigation, and Surveillance (CNS) QAK displays the message on the lower display (DU4). Pushing the CNS QAK when there is no available CPDLC message displays the Tuning 1/2 page. Pushing the CNS QAK again displays the Tuning 2/2 page on the on-side MFW of the bottom display unit (DU4) during normal operation. The Tuning page allows the crew to change the frequencies of any of the radios and NAVAIDs. If a Tuning window is already shown and there is no CPDLC message requiring pilot action, pushing the CNS QAK displays the CPDLC control page. The on-side cursor is placed on the transmit frequency of the last-tuned VHF or HF radio.

CKLST Checklist Quick Access Key

Push the CKLST QAK to show a list of available checklists. The cursor is placed on the next logical step/checklist if a checklist was started or accomplished previously. If no checklist has been previously started, the cursor is placed on the ﬁrst checklist item.

The PREV button is used to return to the previous page of the selected page sequence. When the PREV button is pushed and the cursor is on the plan format, the map center is positioned at the previous waypoint in the waypoint list.
