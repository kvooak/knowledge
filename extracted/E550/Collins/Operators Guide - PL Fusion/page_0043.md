Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 OVERVIEW Pro Line Fusion® Avionics System Description

Onboard Main- tenance System (OMS)

The Onboard Maintenance System (OMS) monitors avionics and aircraft systems to detect failures, isolate faults to a particular unit, and provide historical fault data. This maintenance and fault information is available to show on the AFD. The primary system component of the OMS is the Onboard Maintenance Software Application (OMSA) hosted on the IPS. Storage space is also provided for engine trend and performance data and maintenance data from other aircraft systems. The system supplies the fault information to the AFD through the IPS and system bus structure.

Radio Altime- ter (RAD ALT) System

The Radio Altimeter (RAD ALT) provides a direct radio height measurement from 2500 feet (762 meters) to touchdown for use by the AFCS, EFIS, TAWS, and Trafﬁc Alert Collision Avoidance System (TCAS). The RAD ALT is made up of two radio altitude receiver/transmitters and the system antennas. RAD ALT supplied data is used to generate Radio Altitude Minimum (RA MIN) alerts that are shown on the AFD. Control inputs are provided by the ﬂight references menu. The system supplies digital data to the AFCS, EFIS, and TAWS through the IPS and system bus structure.
