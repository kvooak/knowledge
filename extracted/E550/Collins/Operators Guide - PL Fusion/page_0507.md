Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 AFCS OPERATION Pro Line Fusion® Avionics Approach Modes

• Provide a natural visual transition from the instrument segment to the visual segment approaching the DH. Use the depiction of the runway of intended landing to enable rapid acquisition of the visual references required to complete the landing.

• Enable the ﬂight crew to visually monitor and verify that at 150 ft the trajectory is leading to the touchdown zone.

• When ﬂying the aircraft using manual ﬂight controls, enable the pilot to maintain a stabilized approach within the required ﬂight technical error with minimum workload.

• Enable the pilot to rapidly recognize ﬂight path deviations and trends, in dynamic conditions of turbulence, gusts or offset approach positions, and effectively correct the ﬂight path from these conditions and avoid unstabilized approach
