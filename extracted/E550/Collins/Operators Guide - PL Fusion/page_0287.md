Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 MENUS AND DISPLAYS Pro Line Fusion® Avionics CDTI Features

When the Synthetic Vision System (SVS) is used the TAWS places red (warning) and yellow (caution) images on the display to indicate terrain and obstacles along the route of ﬂight. Obstacles are indicated by rectangles, terrain is indicated using mapped features.

### MAP – TCAS TRAFFIC OVERLAY TCAS trafﬁc information can be shown on the ﬂight displays to assist the pilots in identifying nearby trafﬁc and potential collision threats. A TCAS trafﬁc overlay can be shown on the HSI and DU Map formats.

A TCAS pop-up feature allows automatic display of TCAS data on the DU Maps when a TCAS Trafﬁc Advisory (TA) or Resolution Advisory (RA) is detected by the TCAS computer.

The TCAS trafﬁc overlay is selected on the DU Map through the Map Overlay menu. When the TCAS trafﬁc overlay is being shown and an incompatible Map overlay is selected, the TCAS trafﬁc overlay is automatically removed from that display. The TCAS mode and other selections are available on the ATC/TCAS Control submenu on the DU Tune format.

### COCKPIT DISPLAY OF TRAFFIC INFORMATION Cockpit Display of Trafﬁc Information (CDTI) expands the functionality of Trafﬁc Alert Collision Avoidance System (TCAS). With CDTI installed, full TCAS functionality remains. TCAS trafﬁc avoidance cues and trafﬁc aural alerts remain unchanged.

### CDTI FEATURES

• Directional information for displayed trafﬁc. Target aircraft direction is shown via the arrowhead and orientation of the trafﬁc symbol.
