Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 AFCS OPERATION Pro Line Fusion® Avionics Flight Director Lateral Modes

3. Operate the HDG knob on the FCP to set the heading bug to an intercept heading. Select adding a step for setting course.

4. Push the APPR button on the FCP.

The Back Course mode (Backcourse Approach (APPR Button) and Backcourse navigation mode (LNAV Button) are available), is automatically deselected when:

• Selection or automatic capture of another lateral mode occurs

• The on-side active NAV source or frequency is changed

• The on-side Preselect NAV source is changed when the LOC mode is active

• The GA mode is selected.

When the B/C mode is armed but not captured, system track, roll, Heading and FMS navigation modes could be active while BC mode is armed. Commands are generated to capture and track the selected heading reference (heading bug). Upon B/C capture, commands are generated to track the selected back course. LOC capture deselects the Half Bank mode. When the B/C mode is armed but not captured, a green HDG message is shown in the AFCS lateral active ﬁeld and a white BC message is shown in the lateral arm ﬁeld on the displays. Upon B/C capture, a green BC message is shown in the lateral active ﬁeld on the displays.

#### VOR APPROACH MODE

The VOR approach mode generates ﬂight director/autopilot commands to capture and track the VOR navigation source while in Approach mode. It is armed when VOR is the navigation source and the APPR button is pushed FCP. The VOR control law captures/tracks the VOR radial regardless whether the DME distance signal is valid or invalid.

#### LNAV MODE

While LNAV mode is active, FMS sends lateral steering commands to the AFGS, providing lateral navigation capability according to the selected ﬂight plan and/or operation. It is selected through the LNAV button on the FCP. If FMS is the active navigation source, LNAV can also be selected to support approach operations by pushing the APPR button on the FCP. When used during approach operations, additional annunciation is provided in the FMA.
