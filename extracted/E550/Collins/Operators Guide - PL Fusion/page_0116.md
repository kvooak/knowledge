MENUS AND DISPLAYS Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 ADI – Attitude Pro Line Fusion® Avionics

Flight Director Cue The Flight Director (FD) cue is shown on the attitude indicator as a haloed magenta ring. The FD cue presents pitch and roll guidance information from the AFCS when the FD is active. The cue moves up and down to command a climb or descent, and moves right and left to command a right or left bank. Pitch and roll commands are from the active ﬂight guidance channel. The pilot side active ﬂight guidance channel is active upon power-up. The copilot side ﬂight guidance channel can be selected with the SRC button on the Flight Control Panel (FCP). The FD cue is removed if either the pitch or roll steering inputs are missing or invalid. The FD cue is also temporarily removed when the TCAS RA pitch cues are being shown.
