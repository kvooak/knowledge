NOTE

The pilots should be aware that the LDS is a non-Rockwell Collins avionics unit. Since LDS information is not generated by Rockwell Collins avionics units, it is subject to change by the vendor without notiﬁcation to Rockwell Collins. The Rockwell Collins avionics units described in this Operator’s Guide show typical operation and capabilities. The non-Rockwell Collins avionics units may or may not cause typical operation. Refer to the appropriate vendor documentation for speciﬁc details on the non-Rockwell Collins avionics units.

SELECTIONS:

Lightning Legend (LX)

The LX overlay legend indicates which overlay is selected. The LX overlay information shows in the ﬁrst line of the WXR data block. The LX legend displays in cyan when the LX overlay is active, and displays in white when the LX overlay is inactive.

Lightning Bolt Icons Lightning symbology is shown as lightning bolt icons. The lightning bolt icons show on top of weather radar data and beneath TCAS data.

LDS Fault If an LDS fault is reported when the lightning detection overlay is being shown, a yellow LX FAIL annunciation message is shown ion the HSI above the aircraft symbol. If both the LDS and WXR have failed, the annunciation reads WX/LX FAIL. This annunciation ﬂashes for 5 seconds and then change to steady on. The lightning icons are removed from the display when an LDS fault occurs.
