MESSAGES AND ANNUNCIATORS Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 Visual Annunciations Pro Line Fusion® Avionics

Each ADI compares the airspeed data from the on-side Air Data System (ADS) to the airspeed data from the cross-side ADS full-time. When the difference between the two airspeed values is greater than 10 knots, a boxed yellow IAS airspeed comparator ﬂag is shown above the airspeed tape. The ﬂag ﬂashes for 5 seconds and then changes to a steady-on state.

The indicated airspeed comparator is disabled if:

• Any ADS is failed

• On-side indicated airspeed is less than 90 knots

• A common air data source is selected.

ADI: Altitude Comparator Flag

#### .

The ALT comparator ﬂag is a caution to the ﬂight crew that the altitude data being shown on the ADI may be in error on one side or the other.

Each ADI compares the altitude data from the on-side Air Data System (ADS) to the altitude data from the cross-side ADS full-time. When the difference between the two pressure altitude values is not within a pre-determined limit, the boxed yellow ALT altitude comparator ﬂag is shown above the barometric altitude indicator. The ﬂag ﬂashes for 5 seconds and then changes to a steady-on state.

The altitude comparator limit is variable and is a function of altitude.
