ADI: Mach Comparator Flag

#### .

The MACH comparator ﬂag is a caution to the ﬂight crew that the Mach speed data being shown on the ADI may be in error on one side or the other.

Each ADI compares the Mach data from the on-side Air Data System (ADS) to the Mach data from the cross-side ADS full-time. When the difference between the two Mach values is greater than 0.03 Mach, a boxed yellow MACH comparator ﬂag is shown above the Mach tape. The ﬂag ﬂashes for 5 seconds and then changes to a steady-on state.

The Mach comparator is disabled if:

• Any ADS is failed

• On-side Mach is less than 0.4 Mach

• A common air data source is selected.

#### .

The Barometric (BARO) altitude minimum alert shows to the right of the pitch scale The BARO MIN alert is removed when the current RA is greater than 50 feet above the RA MIN value.

ADI: Radio Altitude Compare Flag

#### .

The RAD comparator ﬂag is a caution to the ﬂight crew that the radio altitude data being shown on the ADI may be in error on one side or the other.
