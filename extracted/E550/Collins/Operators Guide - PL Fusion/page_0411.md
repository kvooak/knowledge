Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 DISPLAY OPERATION Pro Line Fusion® Avionics Introduction

## DISPLAY OPERATION

### INTRODUCTION

The Pro Line Fusion avionics system uses an Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS), which provides the means to gather, concentrate, and show aircraft information to the ﬂight crew. The EFIS consists of four Adaptive Flight Display (AFD) panels, two Cursor Control Panel (CCP) modules, two Multifunction Keyboard Panel (MKP) modules, two Display Control Panel (DCP) modules, and two Reversion Switch Panel (RSP) modules. The EFIS interacts with the Data Concentration System (DCS) and Integrated Processing System (IPS). The CCP and MKP provide controls for the EFIS. These display controls can be used to select data from multiple sensors incorporated in the architecture to ensure display data is available in case of failure. In addition to these controls, some data selection is automatic. For example, if data is missing from Data Concentrator Module (DCM) channel A, the display automatically uses data from DCM channel B.

### DISPLAY UNITS

Four 14 x 11 inch active matrix, color, LCD ﬂight displays are arranged in a T conﬁguration across the ﬂight deck. Each AFD is identical and interchangeable and can take on a variety of display formats depending on location. In this guide and in the on-screen menus, each AFD is called a Display Unit (DU).

The display area is subdivided into windows of the following types:

• Primary Flight Display (PFD), consisting of the Attitude Director Indicator (ADI) and Horizontal Situation Indicator (HSI).

• Engine Indication and Crew Alert System (EICAS).

• Multifunction Window (MFW).

The four DU panels are referred to as DU1, DU2, and DU3, from left to right respectively, and DU4 for the bottom DU. Each DU is also subdivided into halves. For example, the left half and right halves of DU1 are referred to as DU1L and DU1R, respectively. Each half window is then subdivided into sub windows. For example, the top and
