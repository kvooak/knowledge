Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 MENUS AND DISPLAYS Pro Line Fusion® Avionics AFCS Flight Mode Annunciations

Figure 5-20 HUD – AFCS Flight Mode Annunciations

The Automatic Flight Control System (AFCS) ﬂight mode format display shown on the ADI includes the FCS mode messages and the Flight Director (FD) cue. The mode messages are shown above the attitude indicator on the ADI when either FD is selected, the AP, or the AT is engaged. The FD is shown as a magenta ring in the attitude indicator or as a cross pointer during takeoff.

SELECTIONS:

FD Cue The magenta cue is shown on the attitude indicator as a haloed magenta ring. The FD cue presents pitch and roll guidance information from the AFCS when the FD is active. The cue moves up and down to command a climb or descent, and moves right and left to command a right or left bank. Pitch and roll commands are from the active ﬂight guidance channel. The pilots-side active ﬂight guidance channel is active upon power-up. The copilot-side ﬂight guidance channel can be selected with the SRC button on the Flight Control Panel (FCP). The FD cue is removed if either the pitch or roll steering inputs are missing or invalid.
