MENUS AND DISPLAYS Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 Checklist Pro Line Fusion® Avionics

There are up to four checklist types available:

• Normal checklist

• Non-normal checklist

• Emergency checklist

• User checklist.

Normal, non-normal, emergency, and procedures checklists store procedures from the Aircraft Flight Manual (AFM), while the user checklists store items important to the user but not part of the AFM.

The checklists are generated on a personal computer capable of interfacing to a USB memory stick or CD-ROM drive. Rockwell Collins Electronic Checklist Editor Tool (RC Checklist Tool) allows a user to create XML checklist ﬁles and convert the XML ﬁles to ﬁles capable of being loaded into the DCS. The Electronic Checklist Application and the Electronic Checklist Database can be uploaded into the avionics system through the Onboard Data Loader. On-aircraft capability to edit or deﬁne checklists does not exist.

NOTE

For more information, refer to the Rockwell Collins Checklist Tool for Pro Line Fusion® Avionics (CPN: 523–0818292).

The Checklist format is accessed through the drop down format selection button on the Quarter DU formats.

The Checklist formats are synchronized. If a Checklist format shows on both sides of the ﬂight deck, the data is synchronized so both Checklist formats show the most recent information. However, each Checklist format is independently controlled by its on-side cursor.

Each checklist displays its status on the index pages. Checklist status is one of the following states:

• Not Started

• Started (incomplete)

• Asserted

• Overridden

• Complete.
