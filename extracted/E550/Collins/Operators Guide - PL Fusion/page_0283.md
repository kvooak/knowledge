Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 MENUS AND DISPLAYS Pro Line Fusion® Avionics Map – Terrain Overlay

TAWS Messages The TAWS is effectively three independent warning systems in one: ground proximity, terrain, and windshear. Each mode has a distinct aural alert and some modes have associated messages. The Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) is also capable of providing altitude-related callouts and/or an excessive bank angle callout. Refer to the TAWS manufacturer operations manual for functional details. These TAWS-related messages can be shown on the ADI depending on how the individual TAWS installation is conﬁgured:

• WINDSHEAR (red) – Windshear warning

• WINDSHEAR (yellow) – Windshear caution

• PULL UP (red) – GPWS warning

• PULL UP (red) – TAWS warning

• GND PROX (yellow) – GPWS alert

• GND PROX (yellow) – TAWS caution.

Terrain Pop-Up The Terrain pop-up feature allows the DU Maps to be reconﬁgured when a TAWS caution or warning is encountered. The Map automatically switches to a tactical format with a 10 NM range the map reference point switches to aircraft center, the map orientation switches to heading up, and all overlays except WXR, LX, TCAS, and terrain is deselected.

Terrain Status Mes- sages

TAWS status is indicated by overlay status annunciators. The TAWS message ﬁeld is above the bearing information ﬁeld in the lower right of the Map formats.
