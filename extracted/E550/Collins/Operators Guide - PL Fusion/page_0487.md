### HALF BANK

The Half Bank mode is used to reduce the allowable ﬂight guidance commanded bank angle. The maximum ﬂight guidance commanded bank angle is 15 degrees when Half Bank mode is active. The Half Bank mode has no effect on Bank (Hold) mode operation.

Figure 8-4 Half Bank Button

Push the BANK button on the Flight Control Panel (FCP) to limit the maximum ﬂight guidance commanded bank angle to 15 degrees. When active, a green arc appears on top of the ADI roll scale showing the half bank limits. Push the BANK button again to deselect Half Bank mode for full roll authority.

When the autopilot is engaged climbing through 25 000 feet, the system automatically enters Half Bank mode when the autopilot is engaged or the ﬂight director is active. When descending below 25 000 feet, Half Bank mode is automatically deselected.
