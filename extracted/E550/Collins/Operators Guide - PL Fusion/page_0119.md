Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 MENUS AND DISPLAYS Pro Line Fusion® Avionics ADI – Attitude

Unusual Attitude Indication

The ADI is decluttered to ensure the pilot recognizes and corrects an unusual attitude. When the pitch angle is greater than 37.5 degrees nose-up or (-27.5) degrees nose-down, or roll angle exceeds 65 degrees, nonessential information is removed from the ADI (the display is decluttered) and red warning chevrons are shown on the pitch scale. The display returns to normal when pitch angle is (-25.5 < Pitch < +35.5) degrees or roll angle is ≤65 degrees, and the warning chevrons are removed.

The HUD is decluttered to ensure the pilot recognizes and corrects an unusual attitude. When the pitch angle is greater than 37.5 degrees nose-up or (-27.5) degrees nose-down, or roll angle exceeds 65 degrees, the HUD display will be replaced with UA display. The HUD display returns to normal after 3 seconds delay when pitch angle is (-25.5 < Pitch < +35.5) degrees or roll angle is ≤ 65 degrees. The EVS/SVS image will be removed (if displayed) when in UA condition. EVS/SVS image stays removed until the HUD display returns to normal and the pilot selects to display it again.

The EVS/SVS image will be removed (if displayed) when in UA condition. EVS/SVS image stays removed until the HUD display returns to normal and the pilot selects to display it again.

• Control inputs to the ADI from the FCP are inhibited when the ADI is decluttered.
