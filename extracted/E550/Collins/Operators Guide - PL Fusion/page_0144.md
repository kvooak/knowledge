MENUS AND DISPLAYS Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 ADI – Vertical Speed Pro Line Fusion® Avionics

VS indications on the optional Head-Up Display (HUD) provide targeted and current VS readouts.

SELECTIONS:

Vertical Speed Pointer

The VS pointer moves up and down the scale to indicate current VS. As the pointer moves, a green drag line appears to emphasize the VS.

Digital Readout A part-time digital display of VS is shown either at the top or at the bottom of the VS scale. If the aircraft is climbing greater than 300 feet/minute, the digital display is shown at the top of the VS scale. If the aircraft is descending greater than 300 feet/minute, the digital display of VS is shown at the bottom of the VS scale. The VS digital readout is removed when the ascent/descent rate decreases to below 300 feet/minute.

Target Vertical Speed/Flight Path Angle Bug

Targeted VS is only shown when the AFCS VS mode is active. The VS button on the FCP is used to select VS mode. The VS wheel on the FCP is used to set the selected VS. Target VS is shown as a digital readout on the AFCS mode ﬁeld above the vertical speed scale.

• When the VS mode is selected, the VS readout in the AFCS mode ﬁeld appears. The readout is displayed with an arrow pointing up (climbs) or pointing down (descents).
