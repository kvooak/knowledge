# GLOSSARY EXTRACTION

Based on my analysis of the source documents, I found very few explicit definitions. Most terms are used without formal definition. Here are the definitions I could extract:

### ACP (Audio Control Panel)

**Definition**: "The Audio Control Panel (ACP) provides controls for the audio functions of the communications, radio navigation, public address, and interphone systems. The ACP provides controls for selection and volume of all communication and radio navigation channels for the on-side audio system."

**Source**: [Operators Guide - PL Fusion_chunk_0068, Operators Guide - PL Fusion, p.55]

**Status**: DRAFT - REQUIRES HUMAN REVIEW

**Notes**: Clear definition of component function and purpose

### AFCS (Automatic Flight Control System)

**Definition**: "The Automatic Flight Control System (AFCS) consists of a dual-channel Flight Director (FD), Primary Flight Control Computers (PFCC) providing the Autopilot (AP), automatic pitch trim and Yaw Damper (YD) functions, and Autothrottle (AT)."

**Source**: [Operators Guide - PL Fusion_chunk_0046, Operators Guide - PL Fusion, p.36]

**Status**: DRAFT - REQUIRES HUMAN REVIEW

**Notes**: Comprehensive definition including all component systems

### AFD (Adaptive Flight Display)

**Definition**: "The Adaptive Flight Display (AFD) units are color, Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) panels that provide display and control functions for the flight instruments, flight guidance, engine instruments, crew alerting system, navigation, hazard avoidance, and communications systems."

**Source**: [Operators Guide - PL Fusion_chunk_0069, Operators Guide - PL Fusion, p.56]

**Status**: DRAFT - REQUIRES HUMAN REVIEW

**Notes**: Also referred to as Display Unit (DU) in the documentation

### EICAS (Engine Indication and Crew Alert System)

**Definition**: "The EICAS is the interface between the avionics system and the other aircraft systems. The EICAS collects and concentrates engine and other subsystem information to show on the AFD."

**Source**: [Operators Guide - PL Fusion_chunk_0048, Operators Guide - PL Fusion, p.38]

**Status**: DRAFT - REQUIRES HUMAN REVIEW

**Notes**: Interfaces with Radio Interface Unit (RIU) for audio alerts

### FMS (Flight Management System)

**Definition**: "The Flight Management System (FMS) provides lateral and vertical flight plan point-to-point navigation using multiple navigation sensors. The FMS consists of two Flight Management System Application (FMSA) programs hosted in two separate IPC modules, and two Global Positioning System (GPS) sensors."

**Source**: [Operators Guide - PL Fusion_chunk_0049, Operators Guide - PL Fusion, p.39]

**Status**: DRAFT - REQUIRES HUMAN REVIEW

**Notes**: Generates steering commands for AFCS and EFIS

### HGS (Head-Up Guidance System)

**Definition**: "The optional Head-Up Guidance System (HGS) is an electronic Head-Up Display (HUD) that generates and projects flight information in the pilot's forward field of view. The system shows primary flight and navigation data that overlay the outside scene in an accurate conformal relationship."

**Source**: [Operators Guide - PL Fusion_chunk_0049, Operators Guide - PL Fusion, p.39]

**Status**: DRAFT - REQUIRES HUMAN REVIEW

**Notes**: Optional system consisting of PDU, PSU, and HGS application software

### IPS (Integrated Processing System)

**Definition**: "The IPS provides a common computing, data interface, and utility structure to host various avionics functions. The IPS is a modular system that contains two Integrated Processing Cabinet (IPC)."

**Source**: [Operators Guide - PL Fusion_chunk_0050, Operators Guide - PL Fusion, p.40]

**Status**: DRAFT - REQUIRES HUMAN REVIEW

**Notes**: Each cabinet contains PEM and DSM modules plus several CCM for avionics functions

### TAWS (Terrain Awareness Warning System)

**Definition**: "The Terrain Awareness Warning System (TAWS) provides the pilot with increased situational awareness that can reduce the possibility of accidents associated with controlled flight into terrain. The TAWS is effectively three independent systems: a ground proximity warning system, a terrain database and display system, and a reactive windshear warning system."

**Source**: [Operators Guide - PL Fusion_chunk_0051, Operators Guide - PL Fusion, p.44]

**Status**: DRAFT - REQUIRES HUMAN REVIEW

**Notes**: Uses geographic position, altitude data, and internal terrain database for conflict prediction

### TCAS II (Traffic Alert Collision Avoidance System)

**Definition**: "The second-generation Traffic Alert Collision Avoidance System (TCAS), TCAS II, is designed to protect a volume of airspace around the TCAS equipped aircraft by warning the pilots of the threat of other transponder equipped aircraft that penetrate that airspace."

**Source**: [Operators Guide - PL Fusion_chunk_0052, Operators Guide - PL Fusion, p.46]

**Status**: DRAFT - REQUIRES HUMAN REVIEW

**Notes**: Interrogates Mode C and Mode S transponders in nearby aircraft for collision threat analysis

## Terms Used But Not Defined

The following terms appear frequently but lack explicit definitions in the source material:

- **ADI (Attitude Director Indicator)** - Used throughout but definition NOT PROVIDED IN SOURCE
- **HSI (Horizontal Situation Indicator)** - Referenced extensively but definition NOT PROVIDED IN SOURCE  
- **DCS (Data Concentration System)** - Mentioned multiple times but definition NOT PROVIDED IN SOURCE
- **CCM (Common Computing Module)** - Referenced but definition NOT PROVIDED IN SOURCE
- **DMC (Data Concentrator Module Cabinet)** - Used but definition NOT PROVIDED IN SOURCE

**Status**: REQUIRES HUMAN FOLLOW-UP for complete definitions

**Notes**: Most technical terms in this manual are used without formal definition, suggesting this is intended for users already familiar with avionics terminology
