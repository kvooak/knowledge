  "raw_text": "The AFGS provides two types of system con\ufb01guration to support ILS approach operations (APPR 1 and APPR 2). These two types provide an optimized balance between high availability and high integrity.\n\nThe AFGS is designed to provide the highest integrity level available to the pilots, i.e. the nominal con\ufb01guration after pilot selecting ILS approach modes activate APPR 2, as long as the system is capable and the proper con\ufb01gurations have been selected. Regardless of minimums selection, the system will typically operate in APPR 2 con\ufb01guration.",
