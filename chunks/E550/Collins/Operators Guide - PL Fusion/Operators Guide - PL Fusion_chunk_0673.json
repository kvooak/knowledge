  "raw_text": "The Go-Around (GA) mode is selectable through the TOGA switch on the TCQ while not on ground. If it is already engaged, the autopilot remains engaged when GA mode is selected. The AP is allowed to engage when GA is the active mode. The FG generates FD/AP commands to initially maintain a \ufb01xed pitch angle and then transitions to maintain a go-around speed. GA remains active until another mode is selected, or until leveling off at the selected altitude reference.",
