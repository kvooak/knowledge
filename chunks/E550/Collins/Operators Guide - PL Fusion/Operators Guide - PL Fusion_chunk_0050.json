  "raw_text": "OVERVIEW Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 System Description Pro Line Fusion\u00ae Avionics\n\nMultiscan\u2122 Weather Radar System\n\nThe Multiscan\u2122Weather Radar detects and locates precipitation-related weather and precipitation-related turbulence targets for the purpose of navigating around weather hazards, and provides fully automatic operation. The Multiscan\u2122Weather Radar combines multiple radar scans at preselected tilt angles in order to detect weather at various ranges. The weather information is combined to provide an optimized weather picture regardless of aircraft altitude or range selected. The Multiscan\u2122 Weather Radar can also be used to provide limited ground terrain information. The weather and map information can be overlaid on most of the navigation formats on any combination of \ufb02ight displays. The Multiscan\u2122Weather Radar consists of a Receiver/Transmitter Antenna (RTA) assembly mounted in the nose of the aircraft. The RTA contains an antenna, Radio Frequency (RF) assembly, pedestal assembly, and base assembly. The RF assembly contains the receiver and transmitter. The pedestal contains tilt/scan motors and optical feedback switches. The base contains the power supply and signal processing circuits. Weather radar targets and mode messages are shown on the AFD. The Multiscan\u2122Weather Radar is controlled by on-screen menus on the AFD. For more information, refer to the Rockwell Collins RTA-4100 Series MultiScan\u2122Automatic Weather Radar Operator\u2019s Guide (CPN 523-0816797).\n\n5th Edition 2-12 02 APR 19\n\nEmbraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 OVERVIEW Pro Line Fusion\u00ae Avionics System Description\n\nOnboard Main- tenance System (OMS)\n\nThe Onboard Maintenance System (OMS) monitors avionics and aircraft systems to detect failures, isolate faults to a particular unit, and provide historical fault data. This maintenance and fault information is available to show on the AFD. The primary system component of the OMS is the Onboard Maintenance Software Application (OMSA) hosted on the IPS. Storage space is also provided for engine trend and performance data and maintenance data from other aircraft systems. The system supplies the fault information to the AFD through the IPS and system bus structure.\n\nRadio Altime- ter (RAD ALT) System\n\nThe Radio Altimeter (RAD ALT) provides a direct radio height measurement from 2500 feet (762 meters) to touchdown for use by the AFCS, EFIS, TAWS, and Traf\ufb01c Alert Collision Avoidance System (TCAS). The RAD ALT is made up of two radio altitude receiver/transmitters and the system antennas. RAD ALT supplied data is used to generate Radio Altitude Minimum (RA MIN) alerts that are shown on the AFD. Control inputs are provided by the \ufb02ight references menu. The system supplies digital data to the AFCS, EFIS, and TAWS through the IPS and system bus structure.\n\n5th Edition 02 APR 19 2-13",
