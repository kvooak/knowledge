  "raw_text": "The Emergency Descent Mode (EDM) is a function that can automatically bring the airplane to a safe altitude in the ultimate scenario of cabin depressurization and pilots incapacitation. If the AP is engaged, the airplane is above 25000 ft, and a cabin depressurization occurs, the EDM will automatically be activated, which results in FLCH becoming the active vertical mode, with a target altitude of 15000 ft, and HDG becoming the active lateral mode, commanding a 90 degree left turn from the current aircraft heading.\n\n5th Edition 02 APR 19 8-17",
