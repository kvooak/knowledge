  "raw_text": "Overspeed (OVSP) protection is provided when the airplane exceeds its speed envelope (VMO or MMO). This is the same protection provided by the Fly-By-Wire (FBW) system during manual \ufb02ight. Regardless of the AFCS status, concerning active modes and AP engagement status, FBW will activate its overspeed protection when the current speed is higher than VMO or MMO by a predetermined margin, depending on the rate to which the speed increases.\n\nThis margin is de\ufb01ned to avoid activating the overspeed protection unnecessarily (i.e. when there is not a signi\ufb01cant overspeed scenario, while providing the appropriate envelope protection during a signi\ufb01cant overspeed event). When overspeed protection is active and the AFGS status is not FD OFF, the AP and FD commands are synchronized to the current airplane state. Also, OVSP will be displayed in amber on the Active Vertical FD/AP Modes \ufb01eld on FMA.\n\nThe FBW system will generate commands to bring the airplane speed back within its operational envelope. After overspeed protection deactivation, the AFGS will activate vertical modes, depending on the previous vertical active mode before overspeed activation, with synchronized references when applicable, as presented in the following table.\n\n5th Edition 8-18 02 APR 19",
