  "raw_text": "The Flight Path Angle is the basic vertical mode. It becomes the active FG mode when the FG is engaged and no other vertical mode(s) is active. The FG generates \ufb02ight director/autopilot commands to capture and track the \ufb02ight path reference displayed on the selected PFD. The FPA reference is resynchronized to the current \ufb02ight path attitude by pushing the TCS buttons on the control wheel, maneuvering the aircraft to a new \ufb02ight path attitude and subsequently, releasing the TCS button. pushing the FD button when FD is in OFF mode causes the FPA mode to become active. Engaging the autopilot when FD is in OFF mode is active also causes FPA to become the active mode. The \ufb02ight path angle reference is limited to \u00b19.9 degrees, while FPA mode is active.\n\nTo use the FPA mode manually, operate the FCP as follows:\n\n1. Operate the ALT knob on the FCP to select the necessary preselect altitude, different from the current level.\n\n2. Push the FPA button to select the FPA mode.\n\n3. Operate the FPA knob as desired to select a different angle.\n\n5th Edition 02 APR 19 8-13",
