The bug is cyan, and is shown on the scale at an altitude value that corresponds to the preselect altitude setting readout that is shown above the altitude scale.\n\nPreselect Altitude Alert\n\nThe PSA alert noti\ufb01es the pilot that the aircraft barometric altitude is approaching the PSA. The PSA readout \ufb02ashes in cyan and the \ufb02ight deck aural warning sounds when the barometric altitude is within the acquisition limit. The readout stops \ufb02ashing when the barometric altitude is within the deviation limit.\n\n\u2022 The PSA readout \ufb02ashes in cyan and the aural warning sounds when the aircraft barometric altitude closes to within \u00b11000 feet of the PSA.\n\n\u2022 The PSA readout stops \ufb02ashing when the aircraft barometric altitude closes to within \u00b1200 feet of the PSA.\n\n\u2022 The PSA readout changes to yellow, \ufb02ashes, and the aural warning sounds when the aircraft barometric altitude exceeds \u00b1200 feet of the PSA after it has been within \u00b1200 feet of the PSA.\n\n\u2022 The readout changes back to cyan when the aircraft barometric altitude returns to within \u00b1200 feet of the PSA, or if a new PSA is selected.\n\n5th Edition 5-24 02 APR 19\n\nEmbraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 MENUS AND DISPLAYS Pro Line Fusion\u00ae Avionics ADI \u2013 Altitude\n\n\u2022 When the aircraft barometric altitude closes to within \u00b11000 feet of the PSA, but does not get within \u00b1200 feet of the PSA, then exits more than \u00b11000 feet of the PSA, the readout changes to yellow and continues to \ufb02ash.\n\n\u2022 The readout returns to \ufb02ashing cyan when the aircraft barometric altitude again closes to within \u00b11000 feet of the PSA.\n\n\u2022 The aural tone sounds momentarily each time the aircraft barometric altitude crosses the \u00b11000 feet of PSA threshold, whether entering or exiting. The aural ALTITUDE cue sounds momentarily each time the aircraft barometric altitude deviates more than 200 feet from the PSA.\n\n\u2022 The PSA visual and aural alerts are automatically inhibited during vertical approach modes that are in the capture state.\n\nFlight Plan Target Altitude\n\nThe FMS Flight Plan Target Altitude (FPTA) is the next vertical constraint in the current \ufb02ight plan. The FPTA is provided by the FMS and is shown in magenta to the left of the altitude scale when the FMS has an altitude constraint. The FPTA is a function of the current \ufb02ight plan and the position of the aircraft with respect to that \ufb02ight plan. FPTA is shown when all of these conditions are true:\n\n\u2022 FMS is the active NAV source\n\n\u2022 Reference altitudes are in the current \ufb02ight plan.\n\n5th Edition 02 APR 19 5-25",
