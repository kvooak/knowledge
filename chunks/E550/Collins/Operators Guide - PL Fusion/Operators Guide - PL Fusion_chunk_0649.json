  "raw_text": "The Flight Director (FD) cues are presented to the \ufb02ight crew in two formats. For most modes, the guidance is presented in the Flight Path Vector format. And, for takeoff mode, the guidance is presented in the Pitch-based format. Usually, the FD is displayed as a magenta circle, indicating where the pilot should maneuver the airplane \ufb02ight path vector indication to. In this sense, the pilot, when using the FD without engaging the AP (FD only), will try to place the green \ufb02ight path vector circle on top of the magenta \ufb02ight guidance cue. While in takeoff mode, which is an AFD only mode, guidance is provided using a cross-bar symbology, referenced to pitch attitude on the vertical axis, and to the center or the attitude and heading display. The Pilot must try to place the pitch angle indication on top of the magenta pitch guidance bar on the vertical axis, and keep the magenta lateral guidance bar on the center of the display.",
