When the NEXT button is pushed and the cursor is on the plan format, the map center is positioned at the next waypoint in the waypoint list.\n\n\u2190\u2191\u2192\u2193 The MKP arrow keys provide an alternate to the CCP trackball for positioning the cursor on the selected display unit. Each key moves the cursor in the speci\ufb01ed direction. Diagonal movement is possible by pushing two adjacent keys simultaneously. Pushing and immediately releasing an arrow key when the cursor is on a graphical control (Data entry \ufb01eld, button, etc.) jumps the cursor to the closest graphical control in the desired direction. Pushing and immediately releasing an arrow key when it is not on a graphical control moves the cursor a \ufb01xed distance in the desired direction. A push and hold of an arrow key slews the cursor in the desired direction until the key is released.\n\nNAV Navigation Radio Button\n\nThe NAV button takes a frequency entered into the scratchpad and sends it to the on-side NAV radio.
