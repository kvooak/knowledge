Valves consist of a static circular outline and a dynamic three position interior \ufb02ow line. When a valve is parallel to its respective \ufb02ow line, it is open. When a valve is perpendicular to its respective \ufb02ow line, it is closed. A valve in transition is shown as a diagonal to the \ufb02ow line. White circles indicate a working valve, a red X indicates a failed valve. If a valve position can not be determined the system shows a dashed yellow circle.\n\n5th Edition 02 APR 19 5-101\n\nMENUS AND DISPLAYS Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 Synoptic \u2013 Electrical Page Pro Line Fusion\u00ae Avionics",
