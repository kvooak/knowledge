  "raw_text": "The LOC comparator \ufb02ag is a caution to the \ufb02ight crew that the localizer deviation information being shown on the ADI may be in error on one side or the other.\n\nDuring a monitored approach, each ADI compares the localizer deviation from the on-side receiver to the localizer deviation from the cross-side receiver. When the localizer compare function is active and the difference between the two localizer deviations is not within a prede\ufb01ned limit, a boxed yellow LOC miscompare \ufb02ag is shown to the left of the horizontal deviation scale. The \ufb02ag \ufb02ashes for 5 seconds and then changes to a steady-on state.\n\nThe localizer deviation comparator is disabled during unmonitored approaches or when radio altitude is less than either the RA MIN setpoint or 100 feet, whichever is greater.\n\n5th Edition 6-14 02 APR 19",
