This reference may be IAS or Mach, and it is selected through the SPD knob. If the speed knob switch is in MAN, the manual speed mode is selected, or if it is on FMS, FMS speed mode is selected. When the speed reference is selected to manual and TCS is active, the IAS/Mach speed reference is synchronized with the current value. The speed reference is not automatically synchronized with the FLCH in the engagement mode or with the AP engaged while FLCH is active.\n\n1.
