The bank angle reference varies from a maximum bank angle value of +6 degrees to a minimum bank angle value of -6 degrees. The maximum/minimum bank angle value depends on half bank selection.\n\nThe FG enters the Roll Hold mode under any or the following conditions:\n\n\u2022 Roll mode is activated while the bank angle is >+6 degrees\n\n\u2022 Roll mode is activated while the bank angle is <-6 degrees\n\n\u2022 Roll mode is active and bank angle reference is set to >+6 degrees or <-6 degrees, through the use of TCS while AP is engaged.\n\n\u2022 Wings Level: The FG Wings level submode is used to provide the \ufb02ight director/autopilot commands to hold a 0 degrees bank angle. The wings level submode is activated under the following conditions:\n\n\u2022 Roll mode is activated while the bank angle is <=+6 degrees\n\n\u2022 Roll mode is activated while the bank angle is >= (-6 degrees)\n\n\u2022 Roll mode is active and bank angle reference is set to <=+6 degrees or >= (-6 degrees), through the use of TCS while AP is engaged.\n\n\u2022 Heading Hold: Heading Hold submode provides \ufb02ight director/autopilot commands to hold the current airplane heading. The heading hold submode is activated under the following condition:\n\n\u2022 Wings level submode is active and the absolute bank angle is <=3 degrees for 10s.",
