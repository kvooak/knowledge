A speed bump prevents the cursor from accidentally leaving the con\ufb01nes of a window when operating near the edge, yet provides a means for the cursor to intentionally cross the edge when appropriately commanded. Speed bumps allow the CCP trackball or MKP arrow keys to move a cursor between windows on a DU.\n\nA cursor crosses a speed bump when the following process occurs:\n\n1. The cursor hits a speed bump, which causes a stop in cursor motion across the bump.\n\n2. Cursor commands in the axis which would move the cursor across the bump have ceased.\n\n3. The cursor then crosses the speed bump upon resumption of cursor commands in the axis which moves it across the bump.\n\n5th Edition 7-10 02 APR 19",
