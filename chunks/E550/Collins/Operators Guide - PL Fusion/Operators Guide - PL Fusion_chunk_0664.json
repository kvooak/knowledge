  "raw_text": "Lateral autopilot and \ufb02ight director commands can be limited to the nominal bank angle limitation of \u00b130 degrees. When the Half Bank function is active, however, these limits are reduced to \u00b115 degrees. The AFGS automatically transitions to the half-bank limit of 15 degrees, when the airplane altitude is greater than 25 000 ft during a climb.\n\nIt will also automatically transition to the high bank limit of 35 degrees when the airplane\u2019s altitude is less than 25 000 ft during a descent. Hysteresis is also implemented between the two states in order to prevent switching between ON and OFF around the automatic transition altitude (25 000 ft).",
