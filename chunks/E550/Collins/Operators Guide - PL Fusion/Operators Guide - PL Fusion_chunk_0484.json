  "raw_text": "The VSPD comparator \ufb02ag is a caution to the \ufb02ight crew that the VSPEED reference values being shown on the ADI may be in error on one side or the other.\n\nEach ADI compares the FMS-computed VSPEED references received from the on-side FMS to the VSPEED references received from the cross-side FMS. If any on-side FMS VSPEED is 2 or more knots different than its cross-side FMS counterpart, a boxed yellow VSPD miscompare \ufb02ag is shown to the right of the airspeed indicator tape. The \ufb02ag \ufb02ashes for 5 seconds and then changes to a steady-on state.\n\nThe VSPD comparator is disabled if FMS generated VSPEED references are not being posted to the ADI.\n\n5th Edition 02 APR 19 6-19",
