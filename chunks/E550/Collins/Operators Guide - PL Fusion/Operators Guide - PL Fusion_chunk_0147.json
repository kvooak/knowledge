The Mach mode is not selectable when the current Mach is less than 0.40. The Mach display consists of a vertical Mach scale and a \ufb01xed-position pointer. A readout of the current Mach is shown inside the pointer. The range of the scale is 0.40 to 0.998 Mach.\n\nThe Mach readout changes color to yellow for an Overspeed Pre-Alert or a minimum maneuver speed (VMM) cue.\n\nThe Mach readout changes color to red for an Overspeed Alert or a minimum speed (VMIN) cue.\n\nAirspeed Trend Vector\n\nThe airspeed trend vector is a vertical, variable-length white line that is shown to the right of the airspeed scale. The tip of the airspeed trend vector points to the projected airspeed in approximately 10 seconds at the present rate of acceleration or deceleration. The airspeed trend vector is drawn up or down the airspeed scale from the current airspeed (the center of the \ufb01xed airspeed pointer). The airspeed trend vector is shown when the aircraft has been airborne for at least 3 seconds.\n\n5th Edition 5-34 02 APR 19",
