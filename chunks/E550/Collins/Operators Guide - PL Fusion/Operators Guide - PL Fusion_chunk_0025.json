  "raw_text": "\u0002 CAUTION\n\nSome aircraft operators can have special procedures that are different from those given in this guide. Refer to the applicable Aircraft Flight Manual (AFM) for instructions speci\ufb01ed for your aircraft.\n\n\u0002 CAUTION\n\nBe careful if you wear sunglasses with lenses that cause you not to see some colors. These types of lenses can have an unwanted effect on how some colors show on the EFIS displays. You cannot see some items on the display when you wear these types of sunglasses. Also, the color of some items can change. For example, some blue lenses can cause a magenta display item to show as red. If the displays are read incorrectly, possible damage to the equipment could occur.\n\n\u0002 CAUTION\n\nMonitor all instruments to identify if a FMS malfunction occurs. The Pro Line Fusion Avionics System and related components operate as a system and usually give the crew an indication when a malfunction occurs. But the crew must also know that it is not possible to monitor the system for all possible malfunctions. Also, incorrect operation could occur without an indication of a malfunction.",
