Push the SRC button on the FCP to toggle \ufb02ight guidance between the pilot and copilot side.\n\nUpon \ufb02ight guidance transfer, the basic FPA and Roll modes are selected when a FD is active or when the AP is engaged. The FCS system sources everything from the couple side PFD. Attitude, air data and navigation information. Preselect altitude, preselect vertical speed, target FPA, target heading and target airspeed are system synchronized and can never be different between the pilot\u2019s and copilot\u2019s side.\n\nThe couple arrow shows in the bottom half on the AP engage \ufb01eld. The couple arrow shows in green, when present, and when the AP engage/disengage message \ufb02ashes. When the AP engaged/disengaged message is not in view, the couple arrow shows in white and does not \ufb02ash.\n\nThe un\ufb01lled arrowhead (if con\ufb01gured) indicates the non-coupled side.\n\nThe \ufb02ight director is only independent during Approach 2 ILS mode, the \ufb02ight director is never independent during LPV approach, it is always dependent during LPV and all other FMS approaches.\n\nIf the SRC button is pushed during TO or GA without the AP engaged, the FD is removed from the ADI.\n\n5th Edition 8-4 02 APR 19",
