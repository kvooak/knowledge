Pushing a FD button on the FCP selects or deselects the FD on both pilot and copilot DU. Push the FD button to select the FD in basic Pitch and Roll Hold modes. The FD is selected upon lateral or vertical mode selection with the AP not engaged (AP inverse video red). Both Flight Directors are selected upon:\n\n\u2022 AP engagement (AP in green).\n\n\u2022 Go Around (GA) mode selection.\n\n\u2022 Takeoff mode selection.\n\nThe FG application generates steering commands that are presented by the FD on the ADI display when pitch and roll are both valid. Steering commands are generated by the coupled-side FCSA when the Flight Directors are dependent. Steering commands are generated by the on-side FCSA when the Flight Directors are independent. Steering commands are independent when APPR mode is active and GS is the vertical mode. The Flight Director Commands are independent when Approach 2 ILS mode is active.\n\nPush the on-side FD button on the FCP to deselect both FD.\n\nN\n\nNOTE\n\nDeselection of a FD is inhibited on the coupled side while autopilot is engaged, GA is active, TO is active, or APPR is active.\n\nThe FD comes into view and system mode messages are shown on the displays when a FD is selected.
