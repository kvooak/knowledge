The inner peak indicator displays the highest elevation with the half range ring. The outer peak indicator displays the highest elevation from the half range ring to the edge of the display. If two or more points are the same elevation, the peak indicator displays for the point closest to the aircraft.\n\nWhen the peak indicator location is off the viewable area of the map, the peak indicator is parked on the edge of the viewable area, on the correct azimuth, shown in magenta.\n\n5th Edition 5-180 02 APR 19\n\nEmbraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 MENUS AND DISPLAYS Pro Line Fusion\u00ae Avionics Map \u2013 Terrain Overlay\n\nTAWS Messages The TAWS is effectively three independent warning systems in one: ground proximity, terrain, and windshear. Each mode has a distinct aural alert and some modes have associated messages. The Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) is also capable of providing altitude-related callouts and/or an excessive bank angle callout. Refer to the TAWS manufacturer operations manual for functional details. These TAWS-related messages can be shown on the ADI depending on how the individual TAWS installation is con\ufb01gured:\n\n\u2022 WINDSHEAR (red) \u2013 Windshear warning\n\n\u2022 WINDSHEAR (yellow) \u2013 Windshear caution\n\n\u2022 PULL UP (red) \u2013 GPWS warning\n\n\u2022 PULL UP (red) \u2013 TAWS warning\n\n\u2022 GND PROX (yellow) \u2013 GPWS alert\n\n\u2022 GND PROX (yellow) \u2013 TAWS caution.\n\nTerrain Pop-Up The Terrain pop-up feature allows the DU Maps to be recon\ufb01gured when a TAWS caution or warning is encountered. The Map automatically switches to a tactical format with a 10 NM range the map reference point switches to aircraft center, the map orientation switches to heading up, and all overlays except WXR, LX, TCAS, and terrain is deselected.\n\nTerrain Status Mes- sages\n\nTAWS status is indicated by overlay status annunciators. The TAWS message \ufb01eld is above the bearing information \ufb01eld in the lower right of the Map formats.\n\n5th Edition 02 APR 19 5-181",
