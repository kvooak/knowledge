The \ufb02ag \ufb02ashes for 5 seconds and then changes to a steady-on state.\n\nThe LNAV deviation pointer is removed when the LNAV \ufb02ag is being shown.\n\nADI: Radio Altitude Flag\n\nA boxed red RAD \ufb02ag is shown to the left of the radio altitude digital readout when radio altitude data is missing or invalid. The \ufb02ag \ufb02ashes for 5 seconds and then changes to a steady-on state. The RAD \ufb02ag is shown in the same location as the RAD comparator and has priority over the RAD comparator.\n\nADI: SVS Flag\n\nIf SVS is selected, a boxed red SVS \ufb02ag is shown to the right of the altitude scale when SVS data is missing or invalid. The \ufb02ag \ufb02ashes for 5 seconds and then changes to a steady-on state.\n\nDeselecting SVS removes the SVS \ufb02ag.\n\n5th Edition 02 APR 19 6-5",
