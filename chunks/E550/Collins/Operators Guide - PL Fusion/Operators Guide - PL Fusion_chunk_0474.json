When the glideslope compare function is active and the difference between the two glideslope deviations is not within the prede\ufb01ned limit, a boxed yellow GS glideslope miscompare \ufb02ag is shown below the vertical deviation scale. The \ufb02ag \ufb02ashes for 5 seconds and then changes to a steady-on state.\n\nThe glideslope deviation comparator is disabled during unmonitored approaches or when radio altitude is less than either the RA MIN setpoint or 100 feet, whichever is greater.\n\n5th Edition 6-12 02 APR 19",
