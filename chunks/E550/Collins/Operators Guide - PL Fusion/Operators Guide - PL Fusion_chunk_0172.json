The distance information is associated with the active NAV source, providing distance to the:\n\n\u2022 Next waypoint for FMS.\n\n\u2022 Station for VOR.\n\n\u2022 Runway for LOC.\n\nCourse/Desired Track Pointer\n\nThe course/desired track pointer, to/from arrow, lateral deviation/cross-track distance bar, and scale are all shown for all NAV sources (FMS, VOR, and LOC). The course/track pointer is a wide single-bar arrow on the compass display. The pointer is a course pointer when VOR or LOC is the active NAV source, and a track pointer when the active NAV source is FMS. The pointer elements are shown in the same color as the active NAV source. The on-side course for non-FMS NAV sources is set on the FCP using the CRS knobs.\n\n5th Edition 02 APR 19 5-59\n\nMENUS AND DISPLAYS Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 HSI Format Pro Line Fusion\u00ae Avionics\n\n\u2022 A lateral deviation/cross-track distance bar moves to the left and right of the aircraft symbol to indicate the position of the course/track relative to the aircraft. The bar shows lateral deviation that is indicated when the NAV source is VOR or LOC and cross-track distance when the NAV source is FMS. The magnitude of the course deviation or cross-track distance is measured against the lateral deviation/cross-track distance scale.\n\n\u2022 The lateral deviation/cross-track distance scale is shown perpendicular to and intersects the lateral deviation/cross-track distance bar. The scale has markings of two white dots to the left and two white dots to the right of the center line. The lateral deviation/cross-track distance scaling is as follows:\n\n\u2022 VOR \u2013 One dot de\ufb02ection equals 5 degrees of deviation from centerline.\n\n\u2022 FMS provides variable scaling based on the \ufb02ight phase: Terminal area (31NM radius around origin and destination airport) 2 dots equals 1.0 NM.\n\n\u2022 FMS Enroute - 2 dots equals 2.0 NM Approach - 2 dots equals 0.3 NM LPV approaches have angular deviation.\n\n5th Edition 5-60 02 APR 19",
