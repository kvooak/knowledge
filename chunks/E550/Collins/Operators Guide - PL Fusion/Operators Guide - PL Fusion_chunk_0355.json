The Charts are automatically linked by the FMS when a \ufb02ight plan is entered and can also be selected manually by the pilot. The available charts are listed and may be selected through on-screen menus.\n\nThe Chart format may be shown as a full or half screen. One chart may be shown on each side of the \ufb02ight deck, for a total of two.\n\nWhen aircraft position data is available, a moving and geographically referenced aircraft symbol is shown on the Chart being shown. When the current aircraft position is not within the geographically referenced body of the chart, the aircraft symbol displays in magenta at the edge of the chart, on the azimuth relative to the current position. This can happen if the chart is panned or zoomed to an area where the aircraft is not positioned. The aircraft symbol is removed if FMS position, true heading, or magnetic variation data are missing. If the aircraft symbol is removed, the no-aircraft symbol shows in yellow on the menu bar with a white circle and slash.\n\n5th Edition 02 APR 19 5-215\n\nMENUS AND DISPLAYS Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 DU \u2013 Chart Format Pro Line Fusion\u00ae Avionics\n\nN\n\nNOTE\n\nThe use of Charts with the geographically referenced aircraft symbol does not relieve the pilot of responsibility for navigation.\n\nFigure 5-131 Chart \u2013 Menu Bar\n\nThe Chart Menu Bar shows along the top of all Chart MFW formats.
