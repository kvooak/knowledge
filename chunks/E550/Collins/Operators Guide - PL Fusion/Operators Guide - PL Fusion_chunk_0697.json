  "raw_text": "If one of the \ufb02ight guidance modes, Takeoff, Flight Level Change, or Go Around is active, the AT automatically controls thrust to an engine rating level based on that phase of \ufb02ight. The throttles advance or retard to a speci\ufb01ed thrust rating when the AT is in thrust mode.\n\nOn ground, push the AT button to arm TO. A white TO displays in the AT section of the FMA until the throttles are manually advanced above 40 degrees, at which point the AT engages and changes the display to green. When Takeoff mode is selected, the throttles advance to the Takeoff throttle position. During Takeoff Mode the Autothrottle Active Field of the FMA annunciates TO, not IDLE or CLB.\n\n5th Edition 02 APR 19 8-27",
