  "raw_text": "The Pro Line Fusion avionics system uses an Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS), which provides the means to gather, concentrate, and show aircraft information to the \ufb02ight crew. The EFIS consists of four Adaptive Flight Display (AFD) panels, two Cursor Control Panel (CCP) modules, two Multifunction Keyboard Panel (MKP) modules, two Display Control Panel (DCP) modules, and two Reversion Switch Panel (RSP) modules. The EFIS interacts with the Data Concentration System (DCS) and Integrated Processing System (IPS). The CCP and MKP provide controls for the EFIS. These display controls can be used to select data from multiple sensors incorporated in the architecture to ensure display data is available in case of failure. In addition to these controls, some data selection is automatic. For example, if data is missing from Data Concentrator Module (DCM) channel A, the display automatically uses data from DCM channel B.",
