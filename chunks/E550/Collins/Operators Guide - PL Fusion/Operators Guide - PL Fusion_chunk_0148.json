In Manual mode, the SPEED knob on the FCP is used to set the selected airspeed bug value. In Automatic mode, the selected airspeed bug value is commanded by the FMS. The selected airspeed bug is shown on the airspeed scale, as an icon and digital readout above the airspeed scale. The selected airspeed bug, readout, and icon are shown in cyan when manually set with the SPEED knob and are shown in magenta when set by the FMS. The selected airspeed bug is used to show the reference speed for the Flight Level Change (FLCH) mode.\n\nThe speed bug reference displays in knots while in IAS mode, and displays in Mach while in Mach mode.\n\nOverspeed Cue When not in an overspeed condition, the VMAX cue shows as a thick red line on the airspeed scale, extending from the current VMAX to the top of the scale. VMAX is computed as the lessor of VMO, MMO, VLE (landing gear extended limit speed), or VFE (current \ufb02ap extended limit speed).\n\nOverspeed Pre- Alert\n\nAn overspeed pre-alert occurs when the airspeed trend vector exceeds the VMAX value by 3 knots for 5 seconds or more. The overspeed cue is emphasized by changing to a wider red and white barber pole. The airspeed and Mach digital readout changes color to yellow. The pre-alert ends when the airspeed and airspeed trend vector are both less than or equal to VMAX.\n\n5th Edition 02 APR 19 5-35",
