  "raw_text": "The Altitude Hold mode generates FD/AP commands to maintain the correct barometric altitude reference. The altitude reference can be synchronized by pushing the TCS button on the sidesticks. The altitude hold reference is resynchronized with the existing altitude if the mode is selected, and the AP is engaged at a later time if altitude error is greater than 200 ft. The Altitude Hold mode can be selected by pushing the ALT button on the guidance panel. The Altitude Hold mode can also be activated automatically, followed by Altitude Select mode.",
