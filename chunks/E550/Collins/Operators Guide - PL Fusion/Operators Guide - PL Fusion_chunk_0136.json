Metric altitude shows with 5 meter resolution, up to 5 digits in small text, followed by a gray M. No leading zeros show, and negative metric altitude is indicated by a green negative sign. Metric altitude display is selected with the ALT knob on the FCP.\n\nAltitude Trend Vec- tor\n\nThe altitude trend vector is a white thermometer style display that shows the magnitude and direction of vertical acceleration. The altitude trend vector moves upward for a positive vertical speed, and downward for a negative vertical speed. The altitude trend vector is computed to predict the altitude the aircraft achieves (assuming constant velocity) in 10 seconds, up to \u00b1500 feet on the altitude scale.\n\nPreselect Altitude The Preselect Altitude (PSA) setting is capable of being set from zero (0) to 55 000 feet. The PSA is shown in feet when a nonstandard barometric pressure is set. If the standard barometric is set, the PSA is shown as FLXXX. The equivalent metric preselect altitude value can also be selected to be shown on the ADI. Automatic changing of the digital preselect altitude display (\ufb02ashing, color change, or with a yellow underline) provides visual cues of altitude alert or failure conditions. If the DU detects that the PSA is different from the other PFD, a yellow line is placed under the cyan numbers of the PSA.\n\n5th Edition 5-22 02 APR 19",
