Turbulence is only operational when the display range is set at or below 50 NM. When the display range is set to more than 50 NM, the +TURB legend changes color to white, \ufb02ashes for 5 seconds, and then is shown steady on.\n\n\u2022 The second line of the WXR data \ufb01eld shows the antenna tilt angle readout and receiver gain setting. The receiver gain legend is shown by the letter G with a plus or minus sign and the numbers 1, 2, or 3 to indicate any radar gain setting other than 0 (zero) (normal). The tilt angle readout consists of the letter T followed by a plus or minus sign and up to three digits for the readout, except when the tilt is 0 (zero). When the commanded tilt value and the tilt value returned from the radar disagree for more than 5 seconds, the tilt value changes to yellow. The tilt angle readout is replaced by the AUTO annunciation when Autotilt is enabled.\n\n\u2022 The third line of the WXR data \ufb01eld shows the Autotilt mode annunciation or WXR fault message. The WX FAULT annunciation displays in the fourth line of the WXR data \ufb01eld when the radar reports itself failed. WX FAULT shows in yellow, and \ufb02ashes for 5 seconds and then remain steady.\n\n5th Edition 5-194 02 APR 19",
