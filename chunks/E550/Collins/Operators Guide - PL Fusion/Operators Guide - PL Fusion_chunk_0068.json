  "raw_text": "Audio Control Panel (ACP) The Audio Control Panel (ACP) provides controls for the audio functions of the communications, radio navigation, public address, and interphone systems. The ACP provides controls for selection and volume of all communication and radio navigation channels for the on-side audio system. Three ACP are installed.\n\nAir Data System (ADS) The ADS is made up of four Air Data Smart Probes and two Total Air Temperature (TAT) probes. The ADS processes the raw sensor data into digital air data that is provided to the \ufb02ight displays and other aircraft subsystems. Three of the ADSs are used by the avionics, while the other ADS is used by the Standby Flight Instrument System (SFIS) and the Fly-By-Wire (FBW) system. The ADS button on the Reversion Switch Panel (RSP) provides the ability to select a different Air Data System (ADS) in the event of an on-side ADS failure. Air data reversion is automatic when airborne or can be controlled manually. Automatic reversion is inhibited while on ground.\n\n5th Edition 02 APR 19 3-5",
