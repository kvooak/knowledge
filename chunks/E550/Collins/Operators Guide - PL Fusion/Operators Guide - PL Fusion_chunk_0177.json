The selection of the DISPLAYS switch affects both sides of the \ufb02ight deck.\n\nThe compressed HSI shows an abbreviated compass rose, and most of the same information as the non-compressed HSI. The compressed HSI removes the following information:\n\n\u2022 Range control.\n\n\u2022 Traf\ufb01c displays and information.\n\n\u2022 Weather radar returns and information.\n\nWhen the HSI is compressed, the PFD Format menu and all submenus are compressed as well.",
