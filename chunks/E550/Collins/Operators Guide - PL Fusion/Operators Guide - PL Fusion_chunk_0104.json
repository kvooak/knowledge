In the lateral axis commands are generated to hold the heading existing when the TOGA switch is pushed. In the vertical axis commands are generated to maintain a reference airspeed, either FMS or manual. When in Go Around mode, the AT sets go around thrust, equivalent to takeoff thrust. \u2022 Windshear Escape node is selected when the TOGA Control is selected and a TAWS Windshear warning is active. Windshear Escape mode takes into account pitch and airspeed to keep the aircraft \ufb02ying away from the ground in an adverse shear situation.\n\nTrim Switches OEM-provided pitch trim switches are located on each control stick for the purpose of manually trimming the aircraft.
