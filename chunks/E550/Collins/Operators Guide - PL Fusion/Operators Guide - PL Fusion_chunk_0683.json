  "raw_text": "During an underspeed condition, additional levels of protection are provided. When the airspeed is below the top of the Low Speed Awareness (LSA) white bar, the Autothrottle will automatically be engaged if the Autopilot (AP) is engaged.\n\nThe speed reference will be set at the LSA white bar, plus a small offset. If the airspeed keeps on decreasing and gets below the top of the LSA amber bar, the AOA limit function provided by the FBW system will become active. When the AOA limit function is activated, AP will disengage and the airplane will be protected against stall and buffeting at high Mach.",
