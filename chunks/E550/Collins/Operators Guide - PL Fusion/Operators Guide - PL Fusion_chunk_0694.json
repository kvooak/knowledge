Use the depiction of the runway of intended landing to enable rapid acquisition of the visual references required to complete the landing.\n\n\u2022 Enable the \ufb02ight crew to visually monitor and verify that at 150 ft the trajectory is leading to the touchdown zone.\n\n\u2022 When \ufb02ying the aircraft using manual \ufb02ight controls, enable the pilot to maintain a stabilized approach within the required \ufb02ight technical error with minimum workload.\n\n\u2022 Enable the pilot to rapidly recognize \ufb02ight path deviations and trends, in dynamic conditions of turbulence, gusts or offset approach positions, and effectively correct the \ufb02ight path from these conditions and avoid unstabilized approach\n\nFigure 8-8 Synthetic Vision Guidance System\n\n5th Edition 02 APR 19 8-25\n\nAFCS OPERATION Embraer Legacy 450/500 and Praetor 500/600 Autothrottle Pro Line Fusion\u00ae Avionics\n\nFigure 8-9 Synthetic Vision Guidance System, Head-Up Display",
