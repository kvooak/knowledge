The IPS is broken down into a left and right Integrated Processing Cabinet (IPC) for redundancy. Each IPC is a housing that provides power, environmental control, lightning, and HIRF protection for a number of Common Computing Module (CCM)s. These modules are loaded with the software that provides the avionics functions, FMS, SVS, IFIS, eCDU, AMM, TAWS, and OMS.\n\n\u2022 Data from external systems is provided to the IPS for use by internal modules and for distribution to other external systems.\n\n5th Edition 02 APR 19 3-1",
