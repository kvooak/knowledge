Since LDS information is not generated by Rockwell Collins avionics units, it is subject to change by the vendor without noti\ufb01cation to Rockwell Collins. The Rockwell Collins avionics units described in this Operator\u2019s Guide show typical operation and capabilities. The non-Rockwell Collins avionics units may or may not cause typical operation. Refer to the appropriate vendor documentation for speci\ufb01c details on the non-Rockwell Collins avionics units.\n\nSELECTIONS:\n\nLightning Legend (LX)\n\nThe LX overlay legend indicates which overlay is selected. The LX overlay information shows in the \ufb01rst line of the WXR data block. The LX legend displays in cyan when the LX overlay is active, and displays in white when the LX overlay is inactive.\n\nLightning Bolt Icons Lightning symbology is shown as lightning bolt icons. The lightning bolt icons show on top of weather radar data and beneath TCAS data.\n\nLDS Fault If an LDS fault is reported when the lightning detection overlay is being shown, a yellow LX FAIL annunciation message is shown ion the HSI above the aircraft symbol. If both the LDS and WXR have failed, the annunciation reads WX/LX FAIL. This annunciation \ufb02ashes for 5 seconds and then change to steady on. The lightning icons are removed from the display when an LDS fault occurs.\n\n5th Edition 5-198 02 APR 19",
