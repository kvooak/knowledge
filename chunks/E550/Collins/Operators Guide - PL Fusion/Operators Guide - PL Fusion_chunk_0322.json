  "raw_text": "Figure 5-112 Map Radar Overlay Full Page\n\nThe MultiScan\u2122Weather Radar (WXR) System detects and locates precipitation and precipitation-related turbulence returns. The WXR depicts the bearing, range, and precipitation rate of all detectable precipitation within the scan area and display range. A ground mapping mode is used to show ground mapping returns. The system functions like two independent radars. The weather radar display and associated settings for each pilot are controlled from on-side controls and are updated on alternate sweeps of the antenna. The pilot\u2019s display sweeps from the left to the right, while the copilot\u2019s display sweeps from the right to the left.\n\nN\n\nNOTE\n\nThis section discusses control of radar information on the Embraer aircraft. Basic radar theory and operation are detailed in the RTA-4100 Series MultiScan\u2122Automatic Weather Radar Operator\u2019s Guide (CPN 523-0816797).\n\n5th Edition 02 APR 19 5-191",
