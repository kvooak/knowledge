  "raw_text": "The MACH comparator \ufb02ag is a caution to the \ufb02ight crew that the Mach speed data being shown on the ADI may be in error on one side or the other.\n\nEach ADI compares the Mach data from the on-side Air Data System (ADS) to the Mach data from the cross-side ADS full-time. When the difference between the two Mach values is greater than 0.03 Mach, a boxed yellow MACH comparator \ufb02ag is shown above the Mach tape. The \ufb02ag \ufb02ashes for 5 seconds and then changes to a steady-on state.\n\nThe Mach comparator is disabled if:\n\n\u2022 Any ADS is failed\n\n\u2022 On-side Mach is less than 0.4 Mach\n\n\u2022 A common air data source is selected.\n\nADI: BARO Minimum Alert\n\nThe Barometric (BARO) altitude minimum alert shows to the right of the pitch scale The BARO MIN alert is removed when the current RA is greater than 50 feet above the RA MIN value.\n\nADI: Radio Altitude Compare Flag\n\nThe RAD comparator \ufb02ag is a caution to the \ufb02ight crew that the radio altitude data being shown on the ADI may be in error on one side or the other.\n\n5th Edition 02 APR 19 6-15",
