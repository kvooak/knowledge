  "raw_text": "The throttles are controlled to hold a speci\ufb01ed IAS or Mach when the AT is in airspeed mode. If one of the \ufb02ight guidance modes Altitude Capture, Altitude Hold, Vertical Speed, FPA, PATH, GP, or Glideslope is active or subsequently selected, the AT automatically holds selected airspeed. The speed reference is selectable by the pilot either through the FMS, or through the SPD knob on the FCP. When the speed reference is changed, the AT acquires the new selected airspeed. The reference may be IAS or Mach. If a \ufb02ight guidance mode is not selected, the AT provides basic airspeed hold control.\n\nAdjust the reference speed with the SPD knob on the FCP or through FMS waypoint constraints.\n\nPush the PUSH IAS/MACH button inside the SPD knob to select IAS or Mach as the speed reference.\n\nA green SPEED annunciation shows on the PFD when the AT is active. A yellow LIM annunciation shows when the AT can not reach the requested airspeed.\n\n5th Edition 8-28 02 APR 19",
