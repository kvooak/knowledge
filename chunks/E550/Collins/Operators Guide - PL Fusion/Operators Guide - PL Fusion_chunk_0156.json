As the pointer moves, a green drag line appears to emphasize the VS.\n\nDigital Readout A part-time digital display of VS is shown either at the top or at the bottom of the VS scale. If the aircraft is climbing greater than 300 feet/minute, the digital display is shown at the top of the VS scale. If the aircraft is descending greater than 300 feet/minute, the digital display of VS is shown at the bottom of the VS scale. The VS digital readout is removed when the ascent/descent rate decreases to below 300 feet/minute.\n\nTarget Vertical Speed/Flight Path Angle Bug\n\nTargeted VS is only shown when the AFCS VS mode is active. The VS button on the FCP is used to select VS mode. The VS wheel on the FCP is used to set the selected VS. Target VS is shown as a digital readout on the AFCS mode \ufb01eld above the vertical speed scale.\n\n\u2022 When the VS mode is selected, the VS readout in the AFCS mode \ufb01eld appears. The readout is displayed with an arrow pointing up (climbs) or pointing down (descents).\n\n5th Edition 5-42 02 APR 19",
