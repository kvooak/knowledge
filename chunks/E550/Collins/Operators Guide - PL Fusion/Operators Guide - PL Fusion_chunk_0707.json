  "raw_text": "The combiner glass on the PDU has three de\ufb01ned positions: stow, operating and breakaway.\n\nN\n\nNOTE\n\nUsing the breakaway mechanism will necessitate returning the PDU to Rockwell Collins for service.\n\n\u2022 Stow Position: The stow position is the position of the combiner glass when not in use. To stow the combiner glass from the operating position, push the stow mechanism button, which will cause the combiner to move aft slightly. Then rotate the combiner counter clockwise 180 degrees and push up until it locks in the stow position. When the combiner glass is stowed, the stow mechanism holds it tightly in place.\n\n\u2022 Operating Position: The operating position is the position of the combiner glass while in use. To move the combiner glass from the stow to the operating position, push the stow mechanism button. Then rotate the combiner glass 180 degrees clockwise and push forward until the combiner glass snaps into the operating position detent.\n\n\u2022 Breakaway Position: The breakaway position is a safety feature that allows the combiner glass to rotate toward the windshield to prevent head injury (due to combiner contact) during an aircraft high-G deceleration. The breakaway mechanism is single use, and its use will necessitate a return to Rockwell Collins for service.\n\n5th Edition 9-2 02 APR 19",
