When the pitch angle is greater than 37.5 degrees nose-up or (-27.5) degrees nose-down, or roll angle exceeds 65 degrees, nonessential information is removed from the ADI (the display is decluttered) and red warning chevrons are shown on the pitch scale. The display returns to normal when pitch angle is (-25.5 < Pitch < +35.5) degrees or roll angle is \u226465 degrees, and the warning chevrons are removed.\n\nThe HUD is decluttered to ensure the pilot recognizes and corrects an unusual attitude. When the pitch angle is greater than 37.5 degrees nose-up or (-27.5) degrees nose-down, or roll angle exceeds 65 degrees, the HUD display will be replaced with UA display. The HUD display returns to normal after 3 seconds delay when pitch angle is (-25.5 < Pitch < +35.5) degrees or roll angle is \u2264 65 degrees. The EVS/SVS image will be removed (if displayed) when in UA condition. EVS/SVS image stays removed until the HUD display returns to normal and the pilot selects to display it again.\n\nThe EVS/SVS image will be removed (if displayed) when in UA condition.
