  "raw_text": "The ALT comparator \ufb02ag is a caution to the \ufb02ight crew that the altitude data being shown on the ADI may be in error on one side or the other.\n\nEach ADI compares the altitude data from the on-side Air Data System (ADS) to the altitude data from the cross-side ADS full-time. When the difference between the two pressure altitude values is not within a pre-determined limit, the boxed yellow ALT altitude comparator \ufb02ag is shown above the barometric altitude indicator. The \ufb02ag \ufb02ashes for 5 seconds and then changes to a steady-on state.\n\nThe altitude comparator limit is variable and is a function of altitude.\n\n5th Edition 6-10 02 APR 19",
