  "raw_text": "The ATT comparator \ufb02ag is a caution to the \ufb02ight crew that the attitude being shown on the ADI may be in error on one side or the other.\n\nADI compares the attitude from the on-side AHRS to the heading from the cross-side AHRS. Attitude miscompare occurs when the both pitch and roll miscompares are active (it replaces the PIT and ROL \ufb02ags). When the heading compare function is active and the difference between the two headings is not within the prede\ufb01ned limit, a boxed yellow ATT miscompare \ufb02ag is shown below the \ufb02ight mode annunciation display. The \ufb02ag \ufb02ashes for 5 seconds and then changes to a steady-on state.\n\nADI: Flight Path Vector Miscompare Flag\n\nThe FPV Miscompare \ufb02ag shows when the FPV horizontal or vertical difference between any PFD exceeds the FPV comparator limit.\n\n\u2022 Radio altitude at or above 600 feet \u2013 4.46 degrees.\n\n\u2022 The FPV comparator tolerance decreases as a function of decreasing radio altitude when radio altitude < 600 feet and > 200 feet.\n\n5th Edition 02 APR 19 6-11",
