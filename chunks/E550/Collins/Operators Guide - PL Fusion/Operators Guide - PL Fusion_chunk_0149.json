The overspeed marker is emphasized by changing to a wider red/white striped line. The airspeed and Mach digital readout changes color to red. The \ufb02ight deck aural overspeed alert sounds when the current airspeed becomes greater than VMAX by 3 knots. The overspeed symbology returns to previous symbols and/or colors, and the aural alert discrete becomes inactive, when the airspeed is less than or equal to VMO/MMO.\n\nMinimum Speed Cues\n\nWhen not in a minimum speed condition, the VMIN cue shows as a thick red line on the airspeed scale, extending from the current VMIN to the bottom of the scale. VMIN is computed based on AOA. A yellow line extends from the VMIN to the VAOA limiter speed. The airspeed indicator and Mach indicator turn yellow when in this region as well. A white line extends from the VAOA to the VSS (stability speed).\n\nMinimum Speed Pre-Alert\n\nA minimum speed pre-alert occurs when the airspeed trend vector goes below the VMIN value by 1 knot for 1 seconds or more. The airspeed and Mach digital readout changes color to yellow. The pre-alert ends when the airspeed and airspeed trend vector are both greater than the VMIN value.\n\n5th Edition 5-36 02 APR 19",
