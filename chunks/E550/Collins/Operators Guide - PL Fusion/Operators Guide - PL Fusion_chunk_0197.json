When the Vspeeds are manually entered and checked off for display on the airspeed tape, they will be colored cyan in the dialog box. When the FMS calculates and sends Vspeeds to the airspeed tape the speeds will be magenta in the dialog box. The takeoff Vspeeds can be set and checked off manually on the ground. The Landing Vspeeds can be set on the ground (for an emergency return) but to reduce clutter they cannot be checked off for display on the airspeed tape until airborne. When the aircraft takes off the takeoff speeds will be removed automatically and the landing Vspeeds can be checked off for display. In case of an issue with the FMS provided LFE for the arrival airport the LFE can be manually entered on this dialog.\n\nSELECTIONS:\n\nV1 V1 \u2013 Takeoff decision speed.
